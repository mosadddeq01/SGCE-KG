This may indicate an upstream entity resolution or naming issue (loss of specificity) rather than a schema problem. Consider verifying whether the object node should be a concrete butterfly entity or class instead of a generic 'food source'.",
      "justification": "Schema fields (canonical_rel_name='feeds_on', rel_cls='trophic_interaction_relation', rel_cls_group='INTERACTION') are consistent and appropriate, but there is a potential mismatch between the generic object label and the more specific natural language description, which is important for later KG usability.",
