      "justification": "Both relations describe the same semantics: 'new tissues and structures' as a category, with 'butterfly wings' and 'antennae' as specific example members, signaled by the qualifier 'such as'. To normalize the schema, they should share one canonical predicate. 'includes_example' captures the example-membership nuance better than a generic 'includes'. The relation class is aligned to a more specific 'example_membership_relation' rather than two different membership-like labels, and the broad group is unified under ASSOCIATION (set membership / example-of) instead of mixing ASSOCIATION and COMPOSITION for the same pattern.",
