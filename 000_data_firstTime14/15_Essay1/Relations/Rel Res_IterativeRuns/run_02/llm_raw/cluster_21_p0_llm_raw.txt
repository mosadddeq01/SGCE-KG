      "justification": "All three relations describe a beneficial causal effect where a biological process (pollination, reproduction, life cycle stages) helps maintain, continue, or ensure the survival/reproduction of some biological or ecological object. The current canonical names ('contributes_to_maintenance_of', 'supports_continuation_of', 'supports_survival_and_reproduction_of') are overly specific variants of the same generic causal-support predicate. Normalizing them to a single predicate 'supports_persistence_of' reduces unnecessary predicate proliferation while preserving the shared semantics of causally supporting ongoing existence, stability, or continuation.",
      "remark": "If future schema design requires finer distinction between maintenance, continuation, and survival/reproduction, these could later be modeled via qualifiers or more specific sub-predicates, but at this stage a unified causal-support predicate is more consistent.",
