      "justification": "Both relations describe an organism/life stage physically emerging from the chrysalis as an enclosing structure during development. The first relation already uses a structural emergence predicate, class, and SPATIALITY group. The second was treated as a generic emergence event under TEMPORALITY, but its semantics are equally structural with temporal information already captured in qualifiers. Aligning the second relation to 'emerges_from_structure' with rel_cls 'structural_emergence_relation' and rel_cls_group 'SPATIALITY' normalizes semantically identical predicates and keeps temporality at the qualifier level.",
