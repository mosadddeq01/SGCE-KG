Using rel_cls_group=INTERACTION and a more specific rel_cls 'process_interaction_relation' better captures that this is a process involving multiple participants, whereas 'process_spatial_relation' and SPATIALITY are more suited to cases like a process occurring within a single structure (e.g., inside a chrysalis).",
