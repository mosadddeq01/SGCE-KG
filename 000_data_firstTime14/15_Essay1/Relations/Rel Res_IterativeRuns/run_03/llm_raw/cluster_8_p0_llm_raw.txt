Other instances in this chunk that represent the same general semantics already use the canonical_rel_name 'participates_in_biological_process' with a description that explicitly covers both participation and undergoing. Unifying the first two relations to this canonical predicate removes an unnecessary split between 'undergoes_biological_process' and 'participates_in_biological_process' and yields a single, coherent participation predicate for biological processes.",
