The relation is about a developmental event (a butterfly life stage emerging from a chrysalis) that is primarily temporal (moment of emergence) and secondarily spatial, so a more precise rel_cls 'emergence_event_relation' under the broad group 'TEMPORALITY' better captures its semantics while keeping it distinct from pure stage-to-stage transitions.",
