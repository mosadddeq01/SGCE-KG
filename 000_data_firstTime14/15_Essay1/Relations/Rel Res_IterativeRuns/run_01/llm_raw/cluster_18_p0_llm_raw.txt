      "justification": "The relation describes a general ecological causal/supporting effect (caterpillars helping maintain plant population balance), which is semantically aligned with a broad 'contributes_to' predicate. Using 'contributes_to_maintenance_of' introduces an unnecessary specialization compared to the other instance in this cluster (RelR_c8f43fb41026), which already uses 'contributes_to' with an appropriate generic description for the same ecological-effect relation class. Normalizing both to 'contributes_to' improves schema consistency while preserving the causal semantics.",
