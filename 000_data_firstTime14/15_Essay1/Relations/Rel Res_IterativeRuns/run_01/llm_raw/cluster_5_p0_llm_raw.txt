      "justification": "All five relations link the 'butterfly life cycle' process to one of its stages (or to the collection of its stages), which is a part–whole composition semantics rather than pure temporality. Existing fields use slightly different canonical names ('includes_life_stage', 'has_stage', 'has_life_cycle_stage') and relation classes ('process_stage_relation', 'process_stage_membership_relation', 'life_cycle_stage_composition_relation') with mixed rel_cls_group values (COMPOSITION and TEMPORALITY). Normalizing them to a single canonical predicate 'has_life_cycle_stage', a unified class 'life_cycle_stage_composition_relation', and the broad group COMPOSITION yields a consistent schema for life-cycle-to-stage composition edges.",
