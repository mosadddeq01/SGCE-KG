Caption/Title: Temporal Mapping of Equipment Module EquipmentSEMI E10 States to an IPS EquipmentSEMI E10 State

Text surrogate:
An IPS tracked in NST has IPS state NST.  
If an IPS is not tracked in NST, then the IPS is in Operations Time.  
For an IPS in Operations Time, if any processing equipment module is in PRD, then the IPS state is PRD.  
If no processing equipment module is in PRD and IPS reliability computed from UDT equipment modules only is 0 (down), then the IPS state is pure UDT.  
If IPS reliability computed from SDT equipment modules only is 0 (down), then the IPS state is SDT.  
If IPS reliability computed from combined UDT and SDT equipment modules is 0 (down), then the IPS state is mixed UDT.  
If IPS reliability based on UDT and SDT equipment modules is not 0 (not down) and any equipment module is in ENG, then the IPS state is ENG.  
If none of the above conditions apply and no equipment module is in ENG, then the IPS state is SBY.
