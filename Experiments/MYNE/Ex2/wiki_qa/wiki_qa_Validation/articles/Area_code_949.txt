Area code 949 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the U.S. state of California in southern Orange County. The area code was activated for service on April 18, 1998, to a numbering plan area that resulted from a split of area code 714 with a boundary change to exclude the southern cities of Orange County, where the existing central office codes were retained in the new area code.

Service area
The city of Costa Mesa is partitioned between area codes 949 and 714, being split at Wilson Street and along Newport Boulevard. A small section of Irvine also uses 714, from the north side of Culver Drive at Interstate 5 to Jamboree Road in the Marketplace, in the neighborhood of Northpark Irvine.
