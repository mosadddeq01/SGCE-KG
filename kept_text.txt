are being balloted.
NOTICE: Additions are indicated by underline and deletions are indicated by strikethrough.
Background
SEMI E10 is due for its mandatory five-year review. Below is a list of the types of changes included in this revision
along with explanations/justifications as needed.
Scope
A. Various changes required to comply with the latest versions of the Style Manual, Regulations, and
Procedure Manual: Many changes were made but with no actual intended changes from the original
technical meaning. Please especially note the numerous verb changes to comply with Style Manual 4-5.
B. Various mostly editorial changes or very minor technical changes: Many changes were made to
improve wording consistency throughout the Document. One example is standardizing the use of
‘equipment state’ throughout when used to indicate one of the six basic equipment states vs. other uses of
the term ‘state’ in the Document. Another example is to standardize on use of just ‘substate’ beginning in ¶
6.1.3. Changed “suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment by providing” to “suppliers of
manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor and related industries by providing” in ¶ 1.1 to clarify the
additional industry segments covered by SEMI to which E10 applies. Some existing terms used were not
defined so the definitions from SEMI E149 were added. Various other, mostly editorial, changes were
made to address grammar and consistency, but with no actual intended changes from the original technical
meaning.
C. Mutual exclusivity of states and substates: Please especially note the changes in ¶ 6.1.1 and the addition
of ¶ 6.1.3.1.
D. Unscheduled Downtime State (UDT) definition correction/clarification: Please especially note the
changes in ¶ 5.2.67 and the addition of ¶ 6.1.9
E. Improved handling of predictive maintenance conditions: Some equipment/suppliers have added the
capability to predict potential equipment failures before they occur based on monitoring and predictive
models. This capability has now been specifically addressed. Please note that a potential effect of this
change is that some previous unscheduled downtime will now be counted as scheduled downtime. This is
analogous and more consistent with how the scheduled time for change of consumable material has been
handled. Preventing failures (i.e., unscheduled downtime events) using scheduled downtime is considered
more beneficial and less disruptive to manufacturing operations and less likely to cause scrapped units than
unplanned failures. Please especially note the changes in § 6.1.8 and ¶ 5.2.52 along with the addition of ¶¶
5.2.38-40.
F. New metrics for subsystems: A new category of reliability metrics, primarily intended for subsystems,
beyond the current time-based and cycle-based metrics have been added for other ‘work’ factors (e.g., RF-
hours for RF generators, pulse counts for pulse-based excimer lasers in exposure equipment). This increase
in the scope of E10 addresses multiple requests the TF has received to provide more useful, official metrics
for critical subsystems in several different types of equipment systems. Please especially note the changes
and additions in ¶¶ 2.2, 2.3.1, 2.4, 5.2.17, 5.2.61, 5.2.62, 5.2.76, Table 3, 9.2, and 9.5 and §§ 10, Appendix
1, Appendix 2, and Related Information 2.

1 Purpose
R
1.1 This Document establishes a common basis for communication between users and suppliers of semiconductor O
manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor and related industries by providing a standardized methodology for
F
measuring reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) and utilization performance of equipment in a
N
manufacturing environment.
I
2 Scope
2.1 The Document defines six mutually exclusive, basic equipment states into whichfor all of the conditions and
associated periods of time for an equipment system during and observation periodmust fall. One equipment state called
the unscheduled downtime state (UDT) defines a ‘failed’ condition state for an equipment system. The measurement
of equipment system reliability in this Document concentrates on the relationship between equipment system failures
and equipment system usage.
2.2 All metrics defined herein are applicable to equipment systems that include subsystems, noncluster tools, single-
path cluster tools (SPCTs), equipment modules within a multi-path cluster tool (MPCT), intended process sets (IPSs)
of equipment modules, and MPCTs. This Document defines a treatment of RAM and utilization measurement for
MPCTs by first defining performance of IPSs as a function of equipment module-level performance, then defining
MPCT performance as a function of IPS performance. For each metric presented, any special handling required for
IPSs and MPCTs is defined.
2.3 This Document defines basic metrics for:
2.3.1 Reliability — Including mean time between failures (MTBF), and mean cycles between failures (MCBF), and
mean work between failures (MWBF).
2.3.2 Availability — Including total uptime, operational uptime, equipment-dependent uptime, and supplier-
dependent uptime.
2.3.3 Maintainability — Including mean time to repair, mean time to (perform) preventive maintenance, mean time
offline, total failure rate, and impairment rate.
2.3.4 Utilization — Including total utilization and operational utilization.
2.4 Supporting material included in this Document addresses concepts for measurement of mean time between failure
(MTBF), MCBF, and MWBF uncertainty and reliability growth and degradation.
NOTICE: SEMI Standards and Safety Guidelines do not purport to address all safety issues associated with their use.
It is the responsibility of the users of the Documents to establish appropriate safety and health practices, and determine
the applicability of regulatory or other limitations prior to use.
This is a Draft Document of the SEMI International Standards program. No material on this page is to be construed as an official or adopted Standard or Safety Guideline.

3 Limitations
T
3.1 Automated tracking of equipment states and performance is not within the scope of this Document, but is partially O
addressed by SEMI E58 (ARAMS) and SEMI E116 (EPT).
L
NOTE 1: SEMI E58 is currently in Inactive Status and has not been updated to be consistent with and to support the later versions L
of SEMI E10. See Related Information 4 regarding the specific relationship between the SEMI E116 states and those needed by A
this Document.
B
3.2 The results of the calculations contained in this Document are dependent on the operational conditions (e.g.,
L
specifications, processes, recipes, environment, maintenance strategies, human factors) for each user or equipment
A
system type.
N
3.3 This Document does not provide any guidance for assignment of responsibility for equipment system failures to
O
user or supplier, except that certain downtime events and portions of downtime may beare distinguished as being
related to the equipment or dependent on the supplier. Otherwise, the equipment states are determined by functional I
T
issues of the equipment system, independent of who performs the function.
A
3.4 The metrics defined herein do not address efficiency, productivity, diminished throughput, or capacity of
M
equipment systems. Equipment efficiency and productivity are addressed by SEMI E79.
R
3.5 This Document does not address the impact of RAM and utilization changes on cost or other performance metrics.
O
The equipment cost of ownership (COO) Standard SEMI E35 provides the methodology for determining the impact
of RAM and utilization changes on cost. F
N
3.6 This Document is intended to provide a concise treatment of basic reliability concepts of importance to equipment
I
systems, as defined herein, and is not a comprehensive treatment of reliability theory in general.

5.2.2 5.2.3 cluster tool — an equipment system made up of multiple integrated processing equipment modules
T
mechanically linked together. The equipment modules may or may not come from the same supplier.
O
5.2.3 5.2.4 component part — a constituent part, which can be separated from or attached to an assembly, not
L
normally considered capable of independent operation. Also sometimes just called part. [SEMI E149]
L
5.2.4 5.2.5 consumable material — the material used by or in support of the equipment system at any time. Examples A
include gases (e.g., Ar, air), liquids (e.g., acids, solvents, ultrapure water, cooling water, mold compounds), solids B
(e.g., implant sources, bonding wire, lead frames). Examples do not include equipment component parts (e.g.,
consumable parts), support tools (e.g., carriers, probe cards), production substrates (e.g., wafers, die, assembly L
components), monitor/filler units (e.g., test wafers), and facility utilities (e.g., electricity, exhaust). A
N
NOTE 2:NOTE 3: Since the source of these consumable materials may vary from equipment to equipment, site to site, and
company to company, this definition does not distinguish consumable materials based on the delivery method. For example, process O
cooling water may be provided by a dedicated heat exchanger for the equipment or by a facility distribution system, but it should
I
be treated in a consistent manner. T
A
5.2.5 5.2.6 consumable part — component part of the equipment that is consumed by the process operation of the
equipment with a predictable life expectancy of less than one year. It requires periodic replacement to allow the M
equipment to perform its intended function.
R
NOTE 3:NOTE 4: Life expectancy concept comes from SEMI E35. O
5.2.6 5.2.7 continuous downtime event — a downtime event starts when an equipment system transitions into a F
downtime state from an nondowntime uptime state or the nonscheduled state (NST). For example, a transition from N
the productive state (PRD) to a downtime state is starts a continuous downtime event., but aA transition from a
I
scheduled downtime state (SDT) to an unscheduled downtime state (UDT), or vice versa, is notstays in a continuous
downtime event.
5.2.7 5.2.8 cycle — one complete operational sequence (including unit load and unload) of processing, manufacturing,
or testing steps for an equipment system or subsystem. In equipment systems that process units individually, the
number of cycles equals the number of units processed. In equipment systems that process units in batches, the number
of cycles equals the number of batches processed.
5.2.8 5.2.9 downtime (DT) — during an observation period, the accumulated the operations time when the equipment
system is not in a condition, or is not available, to perform its intended function. Downtime includes scheduled
downtime and unscheduled downtime.
5.2.10 downtime event — an initial equipment state transition event either (1) into a scheduled downtime state (SDT)
from an equipment state other than SDT or (2) into an unscheduled downtime state (UDT) from an equipment state
other than UDT. A downtime event can be a transition into UDT from SDT or vice versa. A downtime event is neither
an equipment substate transition within SDT nor an equipment substate transition within UDT.
5.2.9 5.2.11 downtime state — the composite state of the scheduled downtime state (SDT) and the unscheduled
downtime state (UDT).
5.2.10 engineering time — during an observation period, the accumulated time when the equipment system is in the
engineering state (ENG).
5.2.12 engineering state (ENG) — the equipment state when the equipment system is in a condition to perform its
intended function (no equipment or process problems exist), but is operated to conduct engineering experiments,
especially where the usage of the equipment system is not indicative of normal production. ENG includes any activities
required to restore the equipment system to a condition where it may perform its intended function.
5.2.11 5.2.13 engineering time — during an observation period, the accumulated time when the equipment system is
in the engineering state (ENG).
5.2.12 5.2.14 equipment — the combination of hardware and software required to perform an operation or activity
(e.g., processing, transporting, storing), including all direct auxiliary support or peripheral equipment (e.g., vacuum
pumps, heat exchangers, effluent/exhaust treatment equipment). [SEMI E149]
5.2.13 5.2.15 equipment module — an indivisible entity within an equipment system. An equipment module may be
either a nonprocessing equipment module or a processing equipment module.

T
specification input).
O
5.2.15 5.2.17 equipment system — a system of equipment generally capable of independently hosting units for
L
processing, inspection, metrology, or support operations (e.g., transportation, storage, pump down) for which the
L
independent tracking of performance (i.e., reliability, availability, and maintainability ([RAM]), utilization,
A
productivity) is desired. This includes subsystems, noncluster tools, equipment modules, single-path cluster tools
B
(SPCTs), intended process sets (IPSs) in multi-path cluster tools (MPCTs), and MPCTs.
5.2.16 5.2.18 failure — a continuous instance of an unscheduled downtime state (UDT). A failure spans from the L
first transition event (i.e., a failure event) to UDT from an equipment state other than UDT to the next transition to an A
equipment state other than UDT. One or more component or subsystem failures, software or process recipe problems, N
facility or utility supply malfunctions, or human errors could cause an equipment system failure. An equipment system
O
experiences at most one failure at a time; subsequent problems occurring during a failure are not counted as additional
failure events. I
T
5.2.17 5.2.19 failure event — an initial equipment state transition event for an equipment system from an equipment A
state other than unscheduled downtime (UDT) to UDT. Failure events are used for establishing the count of failures M
in an observation period for applicable SEMI E10 metrics.

O
to the equipment or other lower level control system. [SEMI E168]
F
5.2.19 5.2.21 intended function — a manufacturing function that the equipment was built to perform within specified N
operating conditions agreed upon between the user and the supplier. This includes transport functions for transport
I
equipment and measurement functions for metrology equipment, as well as process functions such as physical vapor
deposition and wire bonding. The period of time equipment is performing its intended function includes equipment
initialization and reaching base operating environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure). Complex equipment
may have more than one intended function.
5.2.20 5.2.22 intended process set (IPS) — a predetermined set of equipment modules that is used to achieve a process
and is specified by the user for equipment operation. A multi-path cluster tool (MPCT) may have one or more such
intended process sets (IPSs). An IPS may include alternative equipment modules at one or more steps of the process.
An IPS may therefore contain one or many process paths.
5.2.21 5.2.23 key group (K) — a subset of equipment modules that are common to all intended process sets (IPSs) in
a multi-path cluster tool (MPCT) where the failure of the key group (K) is sufficient to cause a failure of all IPSs and
hence the MPCT. A key group (K) may include a mainframe equipment module.
5.2.22 5.2.24 mainframe equipment module — an individual abstract equipment module that may be used optionally
in modeling a multi-path cluster tool (MPCT) to represent functionality of the equipment system at large rather than
for an individual equipment module. Examples include shared computing resources, information services like recipe
download, and power and gas distribution.
5.2.23 5.2.25 maintainability — the probability that the equipment system will be retained in, or restored to, a
condition where it can perform its intended function within a specified period of time.
5.2.24 5.2.26 maintenance — the act of sustaining equipment in or restoring it to a condition to perform its intended
function. Maintenance refers to function, not an organization; it includes adjustments, change of consumable material,
software upgrades, repair, preventive maintenance (PM), etc., no matter who performs the task.
5.2.25 5.2.27 manufacturing time — the sum of productive time and standby time.
5.2.26 5.2.28 multi-path cluster tool (MPCT) — a cluster tool in which the units visit a subset of the equipment
modules in sequences that vary from unit to unit.
5.2.27 5.2.29 noncluster tool — an equipment system made up of only one processing equipment module.
5.2.28 5.2.30 nonconsumable part — component part of the equipment that is not normally consumed by the process
operation of the equipment. It may require replacement (e.g., due to a failure) with another component part to allow
equipment to perform its intended function.

must shall be in one and only one equipmentSEMI E10 state at any point in time. One of these equipment states—
T
unscheduled downtime (UDT)—represents the initial moment of an equipment system failure (i.e., a failure event)
O
until its recovery from that failure event. Because an equipment system is in one and only one equipmentSEMI E10
state at a time, an equipment system is subject to at most one failure at any point in time, regardless of the number of L
underlying problems contributing to or arising from that failure. L
A
6.1.1.1 For certain equipment systems called intended process sets (IPSs) and multi-path cluster tools (MPCTs),
B
independent tracking of equipmentSEMI E10 states is required for each equipment module in these equipment systems.
These equipment modules may be in different equipmentSEMI E10 states at the same time, and they may experience
L
failures independently from each other.
A
6.1.2 The equipment states are determined by function, not by organization. Any given maintenance procedure, for N
example, is classified the same way no matter who performs it (e.g., an operator, a production technician, a
O
maintenance technician, a process engineer).
I
6.1.3 Figure 1 is a stack chart of the six basic equipment states. These basic equipment states can be divided into as T
many equipment substates (hereinafter substates) as are required to achieve the equipment tracking resolution that a A
manufacturing operation desires. This Document makes no attempt to list all possible substates, but does define M
mutually exclusive substates for the scheduled downtime state (SDT) and the unscheduled downtime state (UDT).;
R
tThese substates are required to support certain metrics and other examples for guidance.
O
6.1.3.1 Besides the substates defined to support certain metrics and other examples for guidance, users may define
F
additional substates (e.g., based on the list of key activities listed as being included for each equipment state) and
N
higher resolution of substates within substates. It is highly recommended that these user-defined substates be mutually
exclusive to avoid double-counting of time if they are used in additional user-defined equations. I

Equipment Time/State Stack Chart
6.1.4 Key activities and conditions associated with the basic equipment states and substates are given in Figure 2.
The accumulated time in equipment states and substates are used in the metrics in this Document. The activities and
conditions associated with the basic equipment states and substates are described in the following sections.

6.1.5 Productive State (PRD) — The equipment state in which the equipment system is performing its intended
function, where the intended function includes performing within the specified operating conditions for which the
equipment system was built and configured. During an observation period, the accumulated time when thean
equipment system is in PRD is called productive time. This Document does not define or require mutually exclusive
substates for PRD, but PRD does include the following activities:
• Regular production (including loading and unloading of units internal to the equipment and conventional recipe
download)
• Work for a third party
• Rework
• Manufacturing support operations (e.g., processing test units to support other processes or equipment)
• Engineering runs done in conjunction with production units (e.g., split lots, new applications)
6.1.5.1 Support activities such as heating, cooling, purging, pump down, cleaning, etc., that are specified as part of
production recipes shall be specifically included in PRD. However, similar support activities that are not specified as
part of production recipes shall be specifically excluded from PRD.
NOTE 4:NOTE 5: Relative to the SEMI E30 (GEM) processing state model, PRD includes all of the ‘executing’ state and portions
of the ‘setup’ state such as loading and unloading. Relative to the SEMI E116 (EPT) equipment module states, PRD includes all
time in ‘busy’ states during SEMI E10 manufacturing time where the SEMI E116 task type is either ‘process’ or ‘support.’ Relative
to SEMI E58 (ARAMS), PRD here is intended to be synonymous with the ARAMS productive state. See Related Information 4

6.1.8 Scheduled Downtime State (SDT) — The equipment state when the equipment system is not available in a
condition to perform its intended function due to scheduled or planned activities or conditionsdowntime events. These
activities or conditionsevents may be based upon accumulated time, equipment usage (e.g., units, work), or equipment
conditions (e.g., predictive models). During an observation period, the accumulated time when thean equipment
system is in SDT is also called scheduled downtime. SDT is divided into the following mutually exclusive substates:
• SDT preventive maintenance
• SDT setup
• SDT maintenance delay, supplier
• SDT maintenance delay, nonsupplier
• SDT production test
• SDT change of consumable material
• SDT facilities related

6.1.10 Nonscheduled State (NST) — The equipment state whenin which the equipment system is not scheduled to be
T
utilized in production. During an observation period, the accumulated time an when the equipment system is in NST
O
is called nonscheduled time. This Document does not define or require mutually exclusive substates for NST, but NST
does include the following activities: L
L
• Unworked Time Periods
A
• Off-Line Training B
• Equipment Installation L
A
• Equipment Modification
N
• Shutdown/Start-up
O
• IPS Nonscheduled (for IPS equipment systems only)
I
T
6.1.10.1 Unworked Time Periods — Shifts, weekends, holidays, facilities shutdowns, etc. out of the production
A
schedule.
M
6.1.10.2 Off-line Training — Equipment system is operated exclusively for training purposes that does not result in
R
any productive output.
O
6.1.10.3 Equipment Installation — Equipment system is out of the production schedule due to initial installation.
F
6.1.10.4 Equipment Modification — Equipment system is out of the production schedule due to modification, rebuild, N
or upgrade (hardware or software) that is not accommodated by the regular PM schedule.
I
6.1.10.5 Shutdown/Start-Up — Equipment system is out of the production schedule due to equipment shutdown and
start-up.
6.1.10.6 IPS Nonscheduled — IPS equipment system is not the current IPS or among the IPSs currently scheduled to
be utilized in production. See § 7.4.6.1 for more details on the IPS nonscheduled stateNST.
NOTE 10:NOTE 11: By tracking inactive IPSs in NST, productive time is more accurately attributed to active IPSs, directly
affecting metrics for IPSs involving productive time. To the extent that multiple IPSs are simultaneously active and have shared
processing equipment modules, productive time cannot be accurately attributed to individual IPSs, and metrics for IPSs involving
productive time may be less useful.
6.1.10.7 NST includes any qualification activities required to bring the equipment system to a condition where it can
perform its intended function after any nonscheduled activities like those listed above.
6.1.10.8 Any maintenance done to the equipment system cannot be counted in NST, since all maintenance (including
automatic maintenance routines such as a programmed cryopump regeneration) must shall be tracked in either SDT
or UDT.
6.1.10.9 By the same convention, any production or engineering work (including an unattended operation that may
shut itself off ‘after hours’) must shall be tracked in either PRD or ENG.
NOTE 11:NOTE 12: NST is intended for omission of strategically unworked periods from total time and should be generally
predetermined in a long-term production schedule. In general, random moment-to-moment periods of idling between productive
periods should be tracked in SBY rather than NST. The only notable exception may be for particularly agile MPCTs that frequently
switch IPSs (e.g., from lot-to-lot), where tracking inactive IPSs in NST aids in the accurate attribution of productive time to active
IPSs.
6.2 Tracking Requirements for Equipment Cycles — For support of certain SEMI E10 metrics, counts of equipment
cycles are also required for each observation period. A cycle is one complete operational sequence (including unit
load and unload) of processing, manufacturing, or testing steps for an equipment system or subsystem. In equipment
systems that process units individually, the number of cycles equals the number of units (e.g., wafers) processed. In
equipment systems that process units in batches, the number of cycles equals the number of batches processed.
6.2.1 Count of Equipment Cycles During Productive Time — The count of equipment cycles during productive time
is used in the metric MCBF .

6.2.2 Count of Equipment Cycles During Uptime — The count of equipment cycles during productive time plus the
T
count of equipment cycles during engineering time. By definition of equipmentSEMI E10 states, there should shall be
O
no equipment cycles during standby time. The count of equipment cycles during uptime is used in the metric MCBF .
u
L
6.3 Tracking Requirements for Downtime Events — For each observation period, aside from aggregating the time in L
each equipmentSEMI E10 state and/or substate, downtime events for each equipment system must shall be tracked
A
and classified for use in SEMI E10 metrics.
B
6.3.1 Downtime Event — A downtime event is an initial equipment state transition event either (1) into SDT from an
equipment state other than SDT or (2) into UDT from an equipment state other than UDT. A downtime event can be L
a transition into UDT from SDT or vice versa. A downtime event is neither a substate transition within SDT nor a A
substate transition within UDT. N
6.3.2 Continuous Downtime Event — A downtime event starts when an equipment system transitions into a downtime O
state from an uptime nondowntime state or the nonscheduled state (NST). For example, a transition from PRD to a I
T
downtime state isstarts a continuous downtime event., but aA transition from SDT to UDT, or vice versa, is not stays
A
in a continuous downtime event. The count of continuous downtime events is used in the metric mean time off line
(MTOL). M
6.3.3 Preventive Maintenance (PM) Event — For a noncluster tool, an SPCT, or an individual equipment module, a R
PM event is a downtime event into SDT where the SDT preventive maintenance substate occurs before the equipment O
exits SDT; PM events for an IPS/MPCT are the aggregate set of PM events of its constituent equipment modules. The
F
count of PM events is used in the metric mean time to PM (MTTPM).
N
6.3.4 Failure Event — A failure event is an initial equipment state transition event for an equipment system from an
I
equipment state other than UDT to UDT. A failure event is a downtime event transitioning into UDT. For a noncluster
tool, an SPCT, or an individual equipment module, a failure event may also be is classified as a repair event if a repair
substate occurs before the equipment exits UDT; repair events for an IPS/MPCT are the aggregate set of repair events
of its constituent equipment modules. Failure events are classified as follows:
6.3.4.1 Failure During Productive Time — A failure event from PRD. This includes failures that occur while
attempting the transition into PRD. The count of failures during productive time is used in the metrics MTBF and
p
MCBF .
p
6.3.4.2 Failure During Uptime — A failure event from PRD, SBY, or ENG. This includes failures that occur while
attempting the transition into those equipment states. The count of failures during uptime is used in the metrics MTBF
u
and MCBF .
u
6.3.4.3 Equipment-Related Failure During Productive Time — A failure event from PRD where the UDT repair time,
equipment-related substate occurs before the equipment system exits the UDT related to the failure event. The count
of equipment-related failures during productive time is used in the metrics E-MTBF and E-MCBF .
p p
6.3.4.4 Equipment-Related Failure During Uptime — A failure event from PRD, SBY, or ENG where the UDT repair
time, equipment-related substate occurs before the equipment exits the UDT related to the failure event. The count of
equipment-related failures during uptime is used in the metrics E-MTBF and E-MCBF .
u u
6.3.4.5 Equipment-Related Repair Event — For a noncluster tool, an SPCT, or an individual equipment module, an
equipment-related repair event is a failure event where the UDT repair time, equipment-related substate occurs before
the equipment system exits UDT. For an IPS/MPCT, the count of equipment-related repair events used in these metrics
is the aggregate count of equipment module-level equipment-related repair events. The count of equipment-related
repair events is used in the metrics MTTR and E-MTTR.
6.3.4.6 Nonequipment-Related Repair Event — For a noncluster tool, an SPCT, or an individual equipment module,
a nonequipment-related repair event is a failure event where the UDT repair time, nonequipment-related substate
occurs—and the UDT repair time, equipment-related substate does not occur—before the equipment exits UDT. For
an IPS/MPCT, the count of nonequipment-related repair events used in this metric is the aggregate count of equipment
module-level nonequipment-related repair events. The count of nonequipment-related repair events is used in the
metric MTTR.
NOTE 12:NOTE 13: It is legitimate to have ‘repairless’ failures that contain neither of the substates UDT repair time,
nonequipment-related substate or the UDT repair time, equipment-related.

6.4 Tracking Requirements for Subsets of Downtime — For each observation period, aside from aggregating the time
T
in each equipmentSEMI E10 state, certain metrics require aggregated time in subsets of both scheduled downtime and
O
unscheduled downtime. These subsets are defined by the downtime substates and by the classification of related
downtime events. L
L
6.4.1 Unscheduled Downtime for Failures During Productive Time — The sum of all time in UDT related to failure
A
events from PRD. This includes time for failures that occur immediately after the transition into PRD. The sum of
B
unscheduled downtime for failures during productive time is used in the metric MFD .
p
6.4.2 Unscheduled Downtime for Failures During Uptime — The sum of all time in UDT related to failure events L
from PRD, SBY, and ENG. This includes time for failures that occur immediately after the transition into those A
equipment states. The sum of unscheduled downtime for failures during uptime is used in the metric MFD . N
u
O
6.4.3 PM Time — For a noncluster tool, an SPCT, or an individual equipment module, PM time is the sum of all time
in the substate SDT preventive maintenance. For an IPS/MPCT, PM time is the aggregate time for all equipment I
T
modules in the IPS/MPCT. PM time is used in the metric MTTPM.
A
6.4.4 Repair Time for Equipment-Related Failures — For a noncluster tool, an SPCT, or an individual equipment
M
module, repair time for equipment-related failures is the sum of all time in the substate UDT repair, equipment-related.
For an IPS/MPCT, repair time for equipment-related failures is the aggregate time for all equipment modules in the R
IPS/MPCT. Repair time for equipment-related failures is used in the metrics MTTR and E-MTTR. O
6.4.5 Repair Time for Nonequipment-Related Failures — The sum of all time in substate the UDT repair, F
nonequipment-related is used in the metric MTTR. N
I
6.4.6 Equipment-Dependent Scheduled Downtime — The sum of all time in the substates SDT preventive
maintenance, SDT setup, and SDT change of consumable material. This quantity is used in the metrics equipment-
dependent uptime (%), equipment-dependent scheduled downtime (%), and equipment-dependent unscheduled
downtime (%).
NOTE 13:NOTE 14: The SDT production test substate is presumed to be primarily dictated by user policy and is excluded from
equipment dependence. The SDT unspecified substate is not clearly associated with equipment dependence and is excluded.
6.4.7 Equipment-Dependent Unscheduled Downtime — The sum of all time in the substates UDT repair, equipment-
related and UDT change of consumable material. This quantity is used in the metrics equipment-dependent uptime
(%), equipment-dependent scheduled downtime (%), and equipment-dependent unscheduled downtime (%).
NOTE 14:NOTE 15: The UDT unspecified substate is not clearly associated with equipment dependence and is excluded.
6.4.8 Supplier-Dependent Scheduled Downtime — The sum of equipment-dependent scheduled downtime (from
§ 6.4.6) and all time in the substate SDT maintenance delay, supplier. This quantity is used in the metrics supplier-
dependent uptime (%), supplier-dependent scheduled downtime (%), and supplier-dependent unscheduled downtime
(%).
6.4.9 Supplier-Dependent Unscheduled Downtime — The sum of equipment-dependent unscheduled downtime (from
§ 6.4.7) and all time in the substate UDT maintenance delay, supplier. This quantity is used in the metrics supplier-
dependent uptime (%), supplier-dependent scheduled downtime (%), and supplier-dependent unscheduled downtime
(%).
7 Additional Concepts and Tracking Requirements for IPSs and MPCTs
7.1 This section presents additional concepts and tracking requirements for intended process set (IPS) and multi-path
cluster tool (MPCT) RAM and utilization performance. While noncluster tools, single-path cluster tools (SPCTs), and
individual equipment modules are either entirely ‘up’ (i.e., in one of the uptime states) or entirely ‘down’ (i.e., in one
of the downtime states), MPCTs are more likely to have a combination of some ‘up’ equipment modules and some
‘down’ equipment modules. An MPCT may can be ‘up’ although individual equipment modules or IPSs within the
MPCT are ‘down’.
7.2 Intended Process Set (IPS) Concepts
7.2.1 An IPS is a particular subset of equipment modules within an MPCT that is used to satisfy a subset of processes
intended to be performed by the MPCT. An MPCT may have one IPS, a few IPSs, or many IPSs.

Phone: 408.943.6900
7.2.2 At each process step, an IPS may be comprised of a unique equipment module or a set of several alternative
T
equipment modules. How the user defines each IPS determines which equipment modules are required for that IPS to
O
be ‘up’ or ‘down’.
L
7.2.3 The equipment state of the IPSs in an MPCT determines the equipment state of the MPCT. If all of the IPSs in
L
an MPCT are ‘down’, then the MPCT is down. If any IPS in the MPCT is ‘up’, then the MPCT is up.
A
7.2.4 In order to evaluate MPCT RAM and utilization metrics, the IPSs shall be predetermined for the MPCT. It is B
important to differentiate between process sets that are possible on a given MPCT configuration and ‘intended’ process
sets that are specified by the user for equipment operation. Two instances of the same MPCT, as offered by the supplier, L
may have different definitions of IPSs based on how the user intends to apply the MPCTs. Also, for a given MPCT, A
the user may change the specified set of IPSs over time to meet changing process needs. N
7.3 Equipment Module Tracking Requirements O
7.3.1 All metrics for IPSs and MPCTs are calculated as functions of equipment module-level data only and require I T
complete tracking of equipmentSEMI E10 state data for all equipment modules that are components of IPSs within
A
the MPCT.
M
7.3.2 Equipment modules in IPSs can include both processing equipment modules and nonprocessing equipment
R
modules (e.g., handlers, load locks, carrier ports). An individual equipment module may belong to one IPS, several
IPSs, or all IPSs for an MPCT. O
F
7.3.3 Certain behavior or functionality that affects the MPCT ‘at large’ and is not clearly attributed to a processing
N
equipment module or nonprocessing equipment module may can be modeled under an abstract mainframe equipment
module. Example items to model in a mainframe equipment module include shared computing resources, information I
services like recipe download, and power and gas distribution.
7.3.4 A ‘key group’ (K) is a subset of equipment modules that are common to all IPSs in an MPCT where the failure
of the key group is sufficient to cause a failure of all IPSs and hence the entire MPCT. A key group may include the
mainframe equipment module if one is tracked for the MPCT. By accurately modeling a key group and leveraging it
in calculations, substantial redundant calculations are avoided. Furthermore, understanding which equipment modules
belong to the key group is crucial in understanding and improving overall equipment system reliability and availability.
7.3.5 Count of Equipment Cycles — For an IPS/MPCT a ‘cycle’ must shall be defined in terms of the intended
function of the entire IPS/MPCT. For example, an IPS/MPCT cycle may can be defined in terms of units, where one
unit passing through the entire IPS/MPCT counts as one cycle, even if not all equipment modules were visited by the
particular unit.
7.4 Temporal Mapping of IPS and MPCT Equipment States
7.4.1 The method of temporal mapping—or mapping over time—defined in this section is used to generate a history
of IPS/MPCT equipment states based on the equipment states of individual equipment modules. IPS equipment states
are determined as a function of equipment module equipment states, and MPCT equipment states are determined as a
function of IPS equipment states.
7.4.2 Temporal mapping provides an output equipment state history for an IPS/MPCT as a function of input
equipment state histories from associated process sets and equipment modules. For each event when at least one of
the equipment modules changes equipment state, the equipment states of the IPS and/or MPCT may can change and
must shall be evaluated. For the metrics in this Document, MPCT and IPS equipment state histories are generated as
functions of equipment module equipment state histories on an event-by-event basis in chronological order. The
metrics themselves are calculated as functions of these generated output equipment state histories.
7.4.3 Figure 3 presents an example of a simple temporal mapping where equipment module states and a desired output
state change from ‘up’ and ‘down’ over time. The input states for two equipment modules, M1 and M2, are shown
over the observation period t = 0 to t = 10. An output state is mapped temporally as a function of the equipment module
states, where if either equipment module is ‘down’ or both equipment modules are ‘down’, then the output state is
‘down’. The set of transition events to evaluate for the output state history is the union set of the transition events for
the input state histories: t = 0, t = 2, and t = 7 for M1 and t = 0, t = 4, and t = 9 for M2.

7.4.4 Temporal mapping may can be performed as each event is generated and received by a SEMI E10-compliant
equipment performance tracking system. Temporal mapping also may can be performed in batch mode at report time. M
Regardless, a logic function is applied at each input equipment state transition event to derive an output equipment

state value as a function of the input equipment state values.

Temporal Mapping of Equipment Module EquipmentSEMI E10 States to an IPS EquipmentSEMI E10 State
7.4.6.1 First, an IPS as a whole must shall be tracked in either NST or in operations time. Any IPS that is not scheduled
to be utilized in production shall be tracked in NST.
NOTE 16:NOTE 17: By tracking inactive IPSs in NST, productive time is more accurately attributed to active IPSs, directly
affecting metrics for IPSs involving productive time. To the extent that multiple IPSs are simultaneously active and have shared
processing equipment modules, productive time cannot be accurately attributed to individual IPSs, and metrics for IPSs involving
productive time may be less useful.
7.4.6.2 Next, if the IPS is not tracked in NST and if any processing equipment module in the IPS is in PRD, then the
IPS is in PRD. If a processing equipment module in PRD belongs to more than one IPS that is not tracked in NST,
then all such IPSs are in PRD.
NOTE 17:NOTE 18: Nonprocessing equipment modules, such as wafer handling equipment modules, are not considered when
determining PRD for an IPS.
7.4.6.3 Otherwise, based on the reliability function of equipment module equipment states for an IPS, if an IPS is in
a downtime state due only to equipment modules in UDT, then the IPS is in UDT.

NOTE 24:NOTE 25: For MPCTs, the failure of an equipment module canmay or may not result, in some cases but not others, in a A
failure of the entire MPCT depending on its definition of IPSs. A failure occurs on the MPCT when none of the IPSs that are M
tracked in operations time can perform its intended function.
R
7.4.7.5 Otherwise, if any IPS in the MPCT is ENG, then the MPCT is in ENG.
O
7.4.7.6 Otherwise, the MPCT is in SBY. SBY that not all of the IPSs are in NST, none of the IPSs (hence none of the
F
processing equipment modules) are in PRD, not all of the IPSs tracked in operations time are in a downtime state, and
N
none of the IPSs are in ENG. If all IPSs that are tracked in operations time are in SBY, then the MPCT is in SBY.
However, there are other combinations of IPSs equipment states for which the MPCT canmay be in SBY (e.g., one I
IPS is in SDT and one IPS is in SBY).

7.5 Modeling Reliability Functions for Intended Process Sets A
B
7.5.1 An IPS ‘up/down’ state is modeled as a network flow through the unique equipment modules that comprise the
IPS. If there is ‘connectivity’ through the IPS network, then the IPS is ‘up’; otherwise it is ‘down’. The equipment
L
modules in an IPS network have series and parallel relationships that determine the connectivity through the network.
A
Mathematically, each equipment module and each IPS has a state value equal to 1 when the module is ‘up’ and 0 when
N
the module is ‘down’. For example,
O
Mi = {1 if module i is up, 0 if module i is down} (1)
I
T
7.5.2 Depending on the particular invocation of a reliability function for an IPS, Mi = 1 may apply for only UDT
equipment modules, for only SDT equipment modules, or for SDT and UDT equipment modules together. These A
variations are used in the IPS SEMI E10 state logic to determine different conditions for which an IPS may can be M
considered ‘up’ or ‘down’.
R
7.5.3 The process steps within an IPS have a mutually serial relationship (i.e., if connectivity is not possible through O
any single step, then connectivity is not possible through the network). This is illustrated in Figure 8. The IPS state
F
value for serial constituents is calculated as the product of the constituent state values (e.g., IPS =  Si = S1 ×
i=1 to 4 N
S2 × S3 × S4).
I
Figure 8
Serial Process Steps within an IPS
7.5.4 At any general process step, S , the set of alternative equipment modules, Ai (if any are present), have a mutually
x
parallel relationship (i.e., if any one of the alternative equipment modules is up, then connectivity through that step is
still possible). This is illustrated in Figure 9. The state value through this step is calculated as:
IPS = 1 −  (1 − Ai) (2)
i=1 to 3
= 1 − [(1 − A1) × (1 − A2) × (1 − A3)] (3)
7.5.5 If any alternative equipment module is ‘up’ (Ai = 1), then the expression in the square brackets evaluates to 0,
and the IPS state value evaluates to 1, or ‘up’. If all of the alternative equipment modules are ‘down’, then the
expression in the square brackets evaluates to 1, and the IPS state value evaluates to 0, or ‘down’.

7.5.6 All IPSs in an MPCT can contain a single ‘key group’ (K), where the state of the key group affects the state of
T
all IPSs. The key group is a subset of equipment modules that appears in every IPS in the MPCT regardless of any
O
process differentiation. The key group may include sets of alternative equipment modules such as multiple load locks
or multiple cooling stations. If this key group is down, then all IPSs in the MPCT (and, consequently, the entire MPCT) L
is down. L
A
7.5.6.1 The example shown in Figure 10 is an MPCT with seven equipment modules used in a single IPS, IPS1. L1
B
and L2 are load lock equipment modules that are used to load units into the MPCT. A single transport arm, T, performs
all point-to-point transportation. The first processing equipment module visited by any unit is either PM1 or PM2,
L
after which every unit visits PM3. Lastly, L3 is a load lock that is used to unload units from the MPCT. Any other
A
issues affecting the MPCT at large are allocated to an additional abstract mainframe equipment module, P (not shown).

8 RAM and Utilization Measurement I
8.1 Observation Periods for Metrics
8.1.1 To calculate metrics, an observation period shall be specified and agreed upon by the user and the supplier.
Appendix 1 ¶ A1-2.9 provides some guidance on establishing the observation period time needed to demonstrate a
desired mean time between failures (MTBF) at a given confidence level.
8.1.2 For any equipment system, the following rules shall be followed to ensure that over multiple observation periods,
neither downtime events nor downtime is ever double-counted.
8.1.2.1 The count of downtime events including failure events that occur during the observation period are included
in all applicable metrics regardless of when the related downtime state is exited. The count of downtime events that
occur before the observation period are not included in metrics even if the related downtime state is exited during or
after the observation period.
8.1.2.2 Downtime time that occurs during the observation period is counted in all applicable metrics regardless of the
start time or end time of the downtime state. For a downtime event that occurs prior to the observation period, the
portion of downtime time that occurs within the observation period is still counted. Hence, an observation period
canmay have associated downtime time without a downtime event occurring during that observation period.
8.1.3 Observation periods shall be specified of appropriate duration so that divide-by-zero errors for metrics are
unlikely.
8.1.3.1 For the equipment reliability metrics defined in § 8.2, the possibility exists of having the case of zero failures,
zero downtime events, etc. in the denominators resulting in a divide-by-zero error, especially for shorter observation
periods or highly reliable equipment. In these cases, the single-value point estimates for these metrics cannot be
calculated and are therefore undefined. However, a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimate can still be calculated
(see § 9.6), but an upper confidence bound (UCB) estimate cannot.
8.1.3.2 For the equipment maintainability metrics defined in § 8.4, the possibility exists of having the case of zero
PM events, zero repair events, or zero downtime events in the denominators resulting in a divide-by-zero error,
especially for shorter observation periods, low maintenance equipment, or highly reliable equipment. In these cases,
the singe-value point estimates for these metrics cannot be calculated and are therefore undefined. For these metrics
calculating LCB and UCB estimates is not appropriate (see § 9.4).
NOTE 25:NOTE 26: Related Information 2 provides an example MPCT usage scenario including calculations of all metrics.

8.4.1.1 MTTPM — Mean time to PM; the average time to complete a PM and return the equipment to a condition
where it can perform its intended function; the sum of all PM time (elapsed time, not necessarily total man hours)

8.4.2.1 Total Failure Rate (TFR) — The rate of equipment module-level failures versus equipment system total time

equipment module-level failures. The denominator is equipment system total time; it is not aggregated. The
A
denominator is limited to calendar time; hence, an equipment system with fewer equipment modules may can reflect

better performance with this metric than an equipment system with more equipment modules (where equipment
modules in both equipment systems have roughly the same failure performance). Calculated in this way, TFR is not a

which is not aggregated. It is limited to calendar time; hence, an equipment system with fewer equipment modules M

8.5 Equipment Utilization — The percentage of time the equipment is performing its intended function during a
specified time period. For IPSs and MPCTs, all of the metrics in this section will shall be based on the temporal
mapped equipment states for the IPSs and MPCT as defined in § 7.
NOTE 30:NOTE 32: By tracking inactive IPSs in NST, productive time is more accurately attributed to active IPSs, directly
affecting metrics for IPSs involving productive time. To the extent that multiple IPSs are simultaneously active and have shared
processing equipment modules, productive time cannot be accurately attributed to individual IPSs, and metrics for IPSs involving
productive time may can be less useful.
8.5.1 Total Utilization (%) — The percentage of productive time during total time. This calculation is intended to
reflect bottom-line equipment utilization.
productive time × 100
total utilization (%) = (384)
total time
8.5.2 Operational Utilization (%) — The percentage of productive time during operations time. This calculation is
intended to be used for equipment utilization comparisons between operations with different work shift configurations,
since it does not include nonscheduled time.

9 Uncertainty Measurements for Some Equipment Reliability Metrics
NOTE 31:NOTE 33: For purposes of simplicity, this section refers to MTBF; however, substitutions can be made for many of the
equipment reliability metrics listed in Table 3 providing they are exponentially distributed (e.g., MFDu and MFDp may can often
not be exponentially distributed).
9.1 The measures of equipment reliability, availability, and maintainability defined in § 8 are single-value point
estimates. They do not indicate the uncertainty or precision of the point estimate. Precision varies depending upon the
number of failures observed and the amount of time contained within the observation period.

9.2 Precision is described by calculating a lower confidence bound (LCB) and upper confidence bound (UCB) for
T
the MTBF, MCBF, and MWBFcalculations and presenting this confidence interval along with the MTBF point
O
estimate.
L
9.3 These procedures assume that the failure rate is constant and the times between failures are independently
L
distributed according to the exponential distribution. Therefore, there are no improvement or degradation trends and
A
it is meaningful to calculate MTBF. § 10 applies when the failure times indicate that a nonconstant failure rate is
B
present (e.g., when there is reliability growth or degradation). § 10 would typically apply during prototype reliability
improvement testing.
L
9.4 Since MTTR distributions may not follow an exponential distribution assumption, applying these procedures to A
put confidence bounds on MTTR and other equipment maintainability metrics listed in Table 5 and Table 6 may be N
inappropriate.
O
9.5 Note that all procedures and tables referred to in this section apply equally well to measuring the precision of
I
point estimates for similar equipment reliability metrics, where hours are replaced by cycles or unitswork, for example. T
These procedures apply to E-MTBF, or E-MCBF, or E-MWBF in the same way. It is also appropriate to combine data A
from identical equipment being used in the same way, in order to improve the precision of MTBF point estimates. M
9.6 Calculation of LCBs and UCBs — To obtain MTBF LCBs and UCBs, multiply the MTBF point estimate by R
factors obtained by table look-up (Tables A0and A0 in Appendix 1). For the case when there are zero failures during
O
the observation period, LCB factors for the MTBF are given in the first row of Table A0 (e.g., they multiply the
F
amount of productive time that had no failures to obtain the desired MTBF LCB). There is no UCB estimate for
N
performance when there are zero failures.
I
9.6.1 Calculation of the MTBF LCB — Use 0in Appendix 1 to obtain a kr;conf factor, where r is the number of failures
observed during the observation period and conf is the confidence level desired. The rows of 0in Appendix 1
correspond to different values of r and the columns correspond to different values of conf. Confidence levels ranging
from 80% to 95% are typical choices.
9.6.1.1 Since the equipment being measured has demonstrated (at a given confidence level) that it is at least as good
as the MTBF LCB, this LCB is an important and useful performance statistic, and is often used contractually.
9.6.1.2 Note that the factors in 0in Appendix 1 for a 90% confidence level are less than 0.5 until the number of failures
equals or exceeds 4. This means that when the number of failures is under 4, the MTBF LCB will be less than half the
MTBF point estimate, and confidence intervals will be wide. From the point of view of precision, it is advantageous
to have had 4 or more failures.
9.6.1.3 Example — During a given calendar quarter, an equipment was productive for 1200 hours and had 6 failures.
The MTBFp point estimate is 1200 / 6 = 200 hours. A 90% LCB factor from 0in Appendix 1 (corresponding to r = 6
failures) is 0.570. That means that 200 × 0.570 = 114.0 hours is a 90% LCB for the true equipment MTBFp.
9.6.2 Calculation of the MTBF UCB — Use 0in Appendix 1 to obtain a kr;conf factor, where r is the number of failures
observed during the observation period and conf is the confidence level desired. The rows of 0in Appendix 1
correspond to different values of r and the columns correspond to different values of conf. Confidence levels ranging
from 80% to 95% are typical choices.
9.6.2.1 Example — During a given calendar quarter, an equipment was productive for 1200 hours and had 6 failures.
The MTBFp point estimate is 1200 / 6 = 200 hours. A 90% UCB factor from 0in Appendix 1 (corresponding to r = 6
failures) is 1.904. That means that 200 × 1.904 = 380.8 hours is a 90% UCB for the true equipment MTBFp.
9.6.3 Calculation of a Confidence Interval for the MTBF — LCB and UCB (i.e., 100 × [1 − α/2]) for the MTBF can
be combined to give a 100 × (1 − α) confidence interval. Here /2 is the chance of missing on either end of the interval.
A 90% LCB has an α/2 = 0.1 chance of not being low enough to capture the true MTBF, and the same is true for a
90% UCB. Therefore, a 90% LCB and a 90% UCB combine to give an 80% confidence interval. Similarly, a 95%
LCB and a 95% UCB would combine to give a 90% confidence interval.
9.6.3.1 Example — During a calendar quarter, an equipment was productive for 1200 hours and had 6 failures. The
MTBFp point estimate is 1200 / 6 = 200 hours. The 90% LCB and UCB are 114 and 380.8 respectively (see §§ A1-

2.6 and A1-2.7 in Appendix 1). The interval (114, 380.8) is then an 80% confidence interval for the true equipment
T
MTBFp.
O
9.6.4 Calculation of the MTBF LCB when There Are Zero Failures — Use the first row of 0in Appendix 1 L
(corresponding to r = 0) to obtain a k0;conf factor corresponding to the desired confidence level. Multiply the length of L
the observation period by this factor to obtain the LCB estimate. A
B
9.6.4.1 Example — During a calendar quarter, an equipment was productive for 1200 hours and had zero failures.
From 0in Appendix 1, the 90% confidence level LCB factor is 0.434. That means that 1200 × 0.434 = 520.8 hours, is
L
a 90% LCB estimate for the true equipment MTBFp.
A
9.6.5 Choosing an observation period length in order to be able to demonstrate a required MTBF at a given confidence, N
we first must shall pick a maximum number of failures, r, that can occur during the observation period and still allow
O
us to confirm a required MTBF objective at a given confidence level. Next, the length of an observation period needed
I
can be calculated using the factors in 0in Appendix 1. The required MTBF is multiplied by a factor based on r and the T
desired confidence level to obtain the total length of an observation period needed. A
9.6.5.1 Note that minimum observation period lengths are obtained by allowing no failures. The cost, however, of M
using a minimum observation period length is to increase the possibility of an acceptable equipment failing the test
R
by chance. As mentioned in the discussion in § 9.6.1.2, it is advantageous to design a test that allows at least four
O
failures, whenever possible.
F
9.6.5.2 Example — We would like to confirm an equipment MTBF of 400 hours at an 80% confidence level. We
N
want to be able to pass a qualification test with four or less failures. We look up the appropriate factor from 0in
Appendix 1 and find 6.72. That means the length of the observation period required is 400 × 6.72 = 2688 hours. We I
can do this on one equipment or split the observation period across multiple equipment systems. When we have
accumulated 2688 hours and if no more than 4 failures have occurred, then we will have demonstrated an MTBF of
at least 400 hours at an 80% confidence level.
10 Reliability Growth or Degradation Measurement
NOTE 32:NOTE 34: For purposes of simplicity, this section refers to MTBF; however, substitutions can be made for the defined
variations of MTBF/E-MTBF, MCBF/E-MCBF, and MWBF/E-MWBF) defined in Table 3.
10.1 The previous calculations are meaningful only when the MTBF (or MCBF or MWBF) and E-MTBF (or E-
MCBF or E-MWBF) are constant over the observation period. If reliability is improving (typical during design
verification and debug and also early life run-in) or if reliability is degrading (typical near the end of life for the
equipment, or if certain subassemblies have been over-stressed and are wearing out), then an overall MTBF calculation
is inappropriate and misleading and other methods must shall be used. Exact time of failure recording is required in
order to detect reliability improvement or reliability degradation trends, and to fit appropriate models.
10.2 Exact Time of Failure Recording — Clock times of failure must shall be converted to durations of cumulative
time as measured from the initial productive use of the equipment (often set as time 0) or from other starting points if
appropriate. This is easily accomplished if total time is continuously monitored by duration within each of the six
basic equipment states.
10.2.1 Example — An equipment system is intended for use during first shift operation five days a week. For
simplicity, assume 100% productive utilization. After the first three weeks of use, it fails half-way through the day,
and is not repaired until the start of the next day’s operation. No more failures occur before the end of the first four
weeks of operation. The exact time of failure is 124 hours (3 weeks of 5 × 8 = 40 hours per week plus half of an 8
hour day). If a second failure occurred 2 hours into the third day of the fifth week, then the exact time of failure would
be 174 hours.
10.3 Reliability Growth (Degradation) Models — A useful family of reliability growth (degradation) models was
developed by the U.S. Army Materials Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA). These AMSAA models are described
in Appendix 2, along with a general test for reliability growth (degradation) trends. Exact time of failure data is needed
to test for trends, fit an AMSAA model, and test the fit for adequacy. The failures used to fit the model must shall
occur during productive time (other failures can occur, but these are not used to fit reliability models).

A1-1 Introduction L
A
A1-1.1 Tables A0 and A0 contain factors that multiply an MTBF, MCBF, or MWBF point estimate to obtain LCBs
and UCBs. 0applies in the common case of time-censored, or cycle-censored, or work-censored data, where the N
equipment is observed for a fixed period of time or for a predetermined number of cycles or work and the number of O
failures that will occur is unknown in advance. The alternative is failure-censored data, where the number of failures
I
is specified in advance and the equipment is observed until that many failures occur. 0contains LCB factors for failure- T
censored data. Since failure-censored data rarely occurs in equipment reliability measurement, 0is only included for A
completeness. The UCB factors given in 0apply to both kinds of censored data. M
A1-1.2 Table A0 can be used to plan equipment assessment or qualification tests in order to be able to demonstrate a R
desired MTBF, MCBF, or MWBF at a given confidence level. In order to use Table A0, you must first choose a

RELIABILITY GROWTH OR DEGRADATION MODELS O
L
NOTICE: The material in this Appendix is an official part of SEMI E10 and was approved by full letter ballot L
procedures on May 12, 2014. A
NOTE 34:NOTE 36: This Appendix offers detailed information related to § 10. B
A2-1 Introduction L
A
A2-1.1 If the times between failures (known as ‘interarrival times’) of a repairable equipment system are independent
random times sampled from the same exponential distribution, then the (theoretical) rate of occurrence of failures is a N
constant  and the MTBF is just 1/. This situation is known in the reliability literature as a homogeneous Poisson O
process (HPP). An HPP assumption underlies the definition of MTBF given in § 8, and the confidence bound factors
I
described in § 9 and Appendix 1. These concepts are described in detail in Ascher and Feingold [1] and Tobias and T
Trindade [2]. A
M
A2-1.1.1 This test can also be applied to test for trends for the MCBF and MWBF metrics using either cycles or work
in place of times to define cycles between failures (known as ‘interarrival cycles’) or work between failures (known R
as ‘interarrival work’).
O
A2-1.2 If reliability is either improving or degrading with time, then the rate of occurrence of failures is no longer a F
constant and an MTBF calculation will be misleading.
N
A2-1.3 This Appendix contains a simple test for trend that may be applied if a time-varying rate of occurrence of I
failures is suspected, as well as a description of a well-known and powerful model that may be used when reliability
improvement trends are evident in the equipment failure time data.
A2-2 Testing for Trends
A2-2.1 A nonparametric ‘reverse arrangement test’ devised by Kendall [3] and further developed into a table by
Mann [4] will be described. Begin by writing the interarrival times in the order they occurred. For a period with r
failures, these might be X , X , …, X. Starting from left to right, define a reversal as any instance in which a lesser
1 2 r
value occurs before any subsequent greater value in the sequence. In other words, any time we have X < X and i <
i j
j, we count it as a reversal.
A2-2.1.1 For example, suppose an equipment has r = 4 failures at 30, 160, 220, and 360 hours of productive time.
The interarrival times are 30, 130, 60, and 140. The total number of reversals is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
A2-2.2 A larger than expected number of reversals indicates an improving trend; a smaller number of reversals than
expected indicates a degradation trend.
A2-2.3 For r up to 12, use Table A0 below (adapted from [2]) to determine whether a given number of reversals, R,
is statistically significant at the 100 × (1 − α) confidence level.

A2-2.4 For r greater than 12, approximate critical values for the number of reversals (based on Kendall’s normal
A
approximation) can be calculated from:
N
(2r +5)(r −1)r r(r −1) 1
R (r; 1-) = zcritical 72 + 4 − 2 O
(A2-1)
I
T
A2-2.5 In this equation z critical comes from the critical values of the standard normal distribution (for 90% significance, A
z = 1.282, for 95% significance, z = 1.645, and for 99% significance, z = 2.33). The formula calculates
critical critical critical M
the critical value for detecting an improvement trend. For degradation trends (a small number of reversals) use (r)(r −
R
1) / 2 minus R as the critical value. Note that (r)(r − 1) / 2 is just the total possible number of reversals when there
r;1-
are r failures. O
F
A2-2.5.1 For example, with 17 failures, the formula for R , using 95% significance, gives a critical number of
r;1-
N
reversals of R = 88. The maximum number of reversals is 17 × 16 / 2 = 136. That means that observing 88 or more
17,95
reversals signals a likely improvement trend, while observing 136 − 88 = 48 or less reversals signals a likely I
degradation trend.
A2-2.6 The example given in the next section shows an application for the reverse arrangement test using Table A0.
A2-2.7 AMSAA Reliability Growth Model — Assume the sequence of interarrival times indicates an improvement
trend. This will typically be the case during reliability improvement testing, where failures are analyzed down to root
causes and actions are taken to improve the equipment’s reliability. Duane [5] observed that a plot of t/k versus t,
k k
where t is the equipment system age at the time of kth failure, typically appears linear on log versus log graph paper.
k
The slope β of this line measures the rate of reliability growth. Typical empirical values of β lie between 0.3 and 0.6.
Crow [6] developed this empirical observation into the power relationship model used by the AMSAA reliability
growth model. This model has proved successful in a wide range of applications.
A2-2.8 The AMSAA model assumes that during reliability improvement testing the MTBF is improving with time
and has an instantaneous value denoted by MTBF (t). When the test ends at time T, the MTBF becomes a constant
I
with the value MTBF (T). A point estimate of the MTBF after a test of T hours with r failures is given by:
I
T
MTBF (T ) =
I r × (1 - ) (A2-2)
A2-2.8.1 This model can also be applied to test reliability growth for the MCBF and MWBF metrics.
A2-2.9 In this equation, β is the reliability improvement (Duane) slope and is estimated by:
r−1
=1-
T
r 1n
i=1 t
i (A2-3)
using the ‘modified maximum likelihood estimates’ given by Crow [6]. Crow developed confidence bounds for
MTBF (T) that are described in [2] and [6].
I
A2-2.9.1 Example — MTBF is used for this example. During a calendar quarter an equipment system has 550 hours
p
of productive time. Eleven failures were recorded at the following points of productive time: 18, 20, 35, 41, 67, 180,
252, 287, 390, 410, and 511 hours. Determine whether there appears to be an improvement trend and use the AMSAA
model to estimate the achieved MTBF at the end of the quarter.
I
A2-2.9.2 Solution — The interarrival times are: 18, 2, 15, 6, 26, 113, 72, 35, 103, 20, and 101. The number of reversals
is 7 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 5 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 40. Using Table A0, this is significant at greater than the 95% confidence

MTBF, RENEWAL PROCESSES, AND THE EXPONENTIAL O

NOTICE: This Related Information is not an official part of SEMI E10 and was derived from the work of the Metrics A
Global Technical Committee. This Related Information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures B
on May 12, 2014.
L
R1-1 MTBF Metrics A
R1-1.1 The concept of MTBF arises from a branch of probability study called renewal theory. Each particular N
definition of MTBF is based on a model of equipment time that is a renewal process. Reliability processes in general O
have ‘up’ and ‘down’ segments in each time cycle (hereinafter in this Related Information section called cycle) that
I
together represent all equipment time of interest. Refer to Figure R1-1. A time cycle in this process begins in an ‘up’ T
segment with equipment in a presumably ‘good-as-new’ state. The equipment continues in the ‘up’ segment until it A
fails and transitions into the ‘down’ segment. When repair is complete or the failure is rectified and equipment is
M
effectively ‘renewed’, the equipment transitions into the ‘up’ segment of a new cycle in the renewal process. The
R
renewal process is defined such that cycles in the process may can be assumed to be statistically comparable to one
another. In simple reliability models, the time for the ‘up’ segment is the time between failures, and the time for ‘down’ O
segment is the time to repair.

‘up’ segments has the Poisson distribution. A system following the distribution is said to have time-average behavior
such that the average of the system behavior over time is the same as the behavior of the ‘average cycle’. In terms of
SEMI E10, MTBF and its related function, MFD, are intended to describe the system at large, and not just a moment
in time. Approaching such a system at random, the observer should expect to find the system ‘up’ with probability
equal to the ratio of ‘up’ time (MTBF) to the average renewal cycle time (MTBF + MFD). The genuine MTBF and
MFD values are assumed by the model to be inherent constants of the system rather than dynamic values, and
measurement of these constants is an ongoing process that improves as more and more data is collected. MTBF point
estimates are generally considered invalid or misleading when observed over small time intervals.
Pr(Equipment Available) = (average time in ‘up’ segment of cycle) / (average time for whole cycle) (R1-1)
= MTBF / (MTBF + MFD) (R1-2)
R1-1.3 Historically, renewal cycle models used MTTR rather than MFD as a companion metric to MTBF. However,
due to the metrics’ definitions in SEMI E10, MTTR and E-MTTR are not necessarily suitable companion metrics to
any variations of MTBF in SEMI E10. Companion metrics in a reliability process must should have the same definition
of failure events and mutually exclusive time in the ‘up’ and ‘down’ segments of the cycle. In this Document, MTBF
u
and MFD are suitable companion metrics, as are MTBF and MFD .

R1-1.4 The collection of ‘up’ and ‘down’ segments of a particular renewal process need not represent 24 hours by 7
days per week. With MTBF , the ‘up’ segment of the renewal cycle is productive time only and the ‘down’ segment
p
is the failure time, repair time, and subsequent requalification time related to only PRD. For MTBF , the ‘up’ segment

specifically excludes engineering time and failures from engineering time, implicitly expecting the likelihood of
T
failures to be different when equipment engineers are ‘pushing the envelope’ of that equipment. Also, the ‘down’

segment specifically excludes PM and other general maintenance issues covered under SDT. NST is neither ‘up’ nor
‘down’ and is entirely excluded from consideration. L

R1-1.5 The meaning of the metric MTBF , then, is literally the productive time of the average renewal cycle as
p A
defined above. Because the exponential distribution is assumed (implicitly) in SEMI E10, this value may be estimated
B
as the cumulative productive time divided by the cumulative failures from productive time. The reciprocal of MTBF
p
expresses how often similar equipment systems should fail as a result of usage strictly in productive time. L

R1-2 Exponential Distribution and MTBF
N
R1-2.1 MTBF in SEMI E10 implicitly assumes an exponential distribution of the time between failures. MTBF is not
O
only the expected value of this distribution. It is also the solitary parameter of this distribution.
I
PDF f(x, MTBF) = (1 / MTBF) × exp(−x / MTBF), x ≥ 0 (R1-3) T
A
CDF f(x, MTBF) = 1 − exp(−x / MTBF), x ≥ 0 (R1-4)
M
E(f(x, MTBF)) = MTBF (R1-5)
R
StDev(f(x, MTBF)) = MTBF (R1-6) O
R1-2.2 The probability that a system will remain ‘up’ for a period longer than t is given by: F
N
Pr(X > t) = exp(−t / MTBF) (R1-7)
I
R1-2.3 The probability that a system will remain ‘up’ an additional time s, having already been ‘up’ t, demonstrates
the memoryless property that is exclusive to the exponential distribution.
Pr(X > t + s | X > t) = Pr(X > t + s) / Pr(X > t) (R1-8)
= exp(−(t + s) / MTBF) / exp(−t / MTBF) (R1-9)
= exp(−(t + s − t) / MTBF) (R1-10)
= exp(−s / MTBF) (R1-11)
= Pr(X > s) (R1-12)
R1-2.3.1 In this case, the distribution of the additional time s is the same as for a new unit and is independent of the
previous time t. This defies the expectation that an equipment system is more likely to fail the longer it has been up.
Qualitatively, the memoryless property says that a system’s resistance to failure is not a function of its age or wear.
R1-2.4 To the extent that the analysts believe the exponential distribution to be representative of times between
failures and that the MTBF is the accurate parameter of that distribution, measures of risk for specific scenarios
canmay be estimated. Table R1-1 below shows the probability of survival time as a percentage of the MTBF.
R1-2.4.1 For example, if MTBF = 500 hours, then the probability of survival for 1000 hours (200% of MTBF) is
13.5%.

R1-3 Analyzing Failure Duration and Times Between Failures for Nonexponential Distributions

reliability renewal cycle with attributes and statistics regarding the cycle’s failure, including the following:

R1-3.2 Given such a list, MFD can be calculated as the mean of the individual failure durations. With individual data L
points, though, other statistical parameters may can be calculated, such as standard deviation, and specific appropriate A
treatment can be given to censored failure data.

R1-3.3 Having the SEMI E10 and non-SEMI E10 attributes allows the separation of data for Pareto analyses by both O
count and cumulative downtime. The attributes may can be used to filter failures for analyses, such as testing for

R1-3.4 Having just the individual time-ordered list of failures allows an analysis to graphically see if failures are

R1-3.5 Having the individual failure start and end times allows the correlation of other equipment system data and R
even nonequipment system data with failures. So in addition to supporting metrics to measure the impact of failures, O
individual data records provide a pathway to understanding and eliminating those failures.

R1-4 Overview

metrics for equipment modules, intended process sets (IPSs), and multi-path cluster tools (MPCTs). Note that this N

R1-5 Example Scenario
R
R1-5.1 This example uses a hypothetical MPCT with a mainframe equipment module, a handler nonprocessing
O
equipment module, and three processing equipment modules: Modules A, B, and C. See Table R2-1. These three
processing equipment modules are used in two intended process sets (i.e., IPS1 and IPS2) each with two process steps. F
N
I
Table R1-2 Hypothetical MPCT Description
Equipment Modules Description
Mainframe (abstract) MPCT platform
Handler Nonprocessing equipment module
Module A Processing equipment module
Module B Processing equipment module
Module C Processing equipment module
R1-5.2 An abstract mainframe equipment module is used to track failures for the MPCT ‘at large’ including physical
facilities resources, information to and from the host, and common computing resources. For this hypothetical MPCT,
there are no ‘active’ tasks to track for the mainframe equipment module; hence, no productive time is ever tracked
and this equipment module is more likely to be in SBY. It is therefore also true for this equipment module that metrics
dependent on productive time (e.g., utilization [%]) do not yield meaningful values.
R1-5.3 For this hypothetical MPCT, all normal operations performed by the handler nonprocessing equipment
module are treated as productive time regardless of the purpose of the units being handled. Hence, there is no tracking
of certain equipmentSEMI E10 states (e.g., ENG, SDT) for this equipment module.
R1-5.4 The mainframe equipment module, the handler nonprocessing equipment module, and Module A are required
for both IPSs. If any of these equipment modules go down, then IPS1, IPS2, and the MPCT (in the absence of
processing equipment modules in PRD) would go down. Hence, they are candidates for a key group, K, when
determining the reliability functions for IPS1 and IPS2. For the module states defined as (1 = Up, 0 = Down), Mm
(Mainframe module), Mh (Handler module), Ma (Module A), Mb (Module B), Mc (Module C), the reliability functions
for K, IPS1, and IPS2 are as follows:
K = Mm × Mh × Ma (R2-1)
IPS1 = K × Mb (R2-2)
IPS2 = K × (1 − [(1−Mb) × (1−Mc)]) (R2-3)
R1-5.5 For IPS1, process step 1 requires Module A and process step 2 requires Module B. For IPS2, process step 1
requires Module A and process step 2 uses either Module B or Module C. See Table R2-2.

R1-5.7 An overview of this scenario demonstrates how SEMI E10 tracking applies to individual equipment modules,
IPSs, and an MPCT. Refer to Table R2-5 for the details of each event.
R1-5.7.1 The scenario demonstrated the use of NST to isolate active IPSs. The scenario begins with all equipment
modules and both IPSs in NST, which is the only way in which an MPCT can also be in NST. From event #2 through
event #8, IPS2 is in NST and IPS2 is in operations time. From event #9 through event #28, IPS1 is in NST and IPS2
is in operations time. From event #39 through the end of the scenario, both IPSs are simultaneously in operations time.
R1-5.7.2 The scenario demonstrates several equipment modules failures with different effects on the IPSs and MPCT.
R1-5.7.2.1 The Handler module is in UDT from events #20 until event #23. Because IPS2 and the MPCT are still in
PRD until event #21, they each delay going into UDT.
R1-5.7.2.2 Module A goes into UDT from ENG at event #30 and remains in UDT until event #40. IPS1 has a failure
event from ENG. IPS2 and the MPCT continue in PRD until event #34, then they both experience failure events from
PRD.
R1-5.7.2.3 Module C is in UDT at event #41 through event #44, but does not put either IPS or the MPCT in UDT.
This is because Module B, the alternative to Module C in IPS2, remains in SBY.
R1-5.7.2.4 The Mainframe module has a facilities-related failure from event #43 through event #45 that also puts
both IPSs and the MPCT in UDT. Even though the failure of Module C is remedied at event #44, the IPSs and MPCT
remain down because of the Mainframe module in UDT.
R1-5.7.3 The scenario demonstrates how different equipment modules in ENG affect the IPSs and MPCT differently.
R1-5.7.3.1 Module A is in ENG from event #30 until event #32. IPS1 is in ENG because it has no other processing
equipment modules in PRD, UDT, or SDT. IPS2 is in PRD during this same time because Module C, which is
exclusive to IPS2, is in PRD.
R1-5.7.3.2 The Mainframe module is in ENG from event #47 through event #48. With all other equipment modules
in SBY, both IPSs and the MPCT are in ENG.
R1-5.7.4 The scenario demonstrates different effects of SDT equipment modules.
R1-5.7.4.1 From event #3 through event #8, the scenario demonstrates the substate SDT production test due to a
monitor unit. As the monitor unit passes from Module A to Module B, IPS1 and MPCT are in SDT production test.

R1-5.7.4.2 While Module A is in UDT, at event #37, preventive maintenance is performed on Module B. Then at
T
event #38, preventive maintenance is performed on Module C. Both IPSs and the MPCT remain in UDT regardless
O
of the preventive maintenance.
L
R1-5.7.4.3 Preventive maintenance is performed on Module A from event #42 through event #46. Both IPSs and the
L
MPCT are in the substate SDT preventive maintenance. However, when the Mainframe module fails at event #43
A
through event #45, both IPSs and the MPCT are in UDT because of that failure. When the Mainframe module is
B
tracked into SBY at event #45, both IPSs and the MPCT revert to the substate SDT preventive maintenance, while the
preventive maintenance on Module A continues until event #46. This has the odd event of having the one preventive
L
maintenance operation on Module A look like two separate operations on each of the IPSs and the MPCT. But since
A
the MTTPM metric is based on equipment module-level aggregates, only one PM event and the complete correct time

each of the equipment modules, IPSs, and the MPCT.
R1-8.2.1.1 In this scenario, although the IPSs and MPCT have low values for Total Uptime and Operational Uptime
metrics, a significant amount of the downtime is neither equipment dependent nor supplier dependent. This is reflected
in higher values for Equipment-Dependent Uptime and Supplier-Dependent Uptime.

Global Technical Committee. This Related Information was approved for publication by full letter ballot procedures B
on May 12, 2014.
L
R1-9 Introduction A
R1-9.1 SEMI E10 has been revised multiple times since the currently Inactive SEMI E58 (ARAMS) Standard has N
been revised. Some of these changes have resulted in some revisions being needed to the content currently provided O
in SEMI E58 in order to be fully consistent with the content in SEMI E10. The content with the recommended changes
I
is provided in this section. However, please note that this section does not contain all of the changes needed to bring T
the entire SEMI E58 into complete consistency with SEMI E10. It includes the content changes related to the reserved A
numerical and text codes.
M
R1-9.2 For user convenience, this section also reproduces the color codes defined in SEMI E58 for the six basic R
equipment states defined in SEMI E10.

NOTE 34: This section reproduces the content contained in § 18.4 of SEMI E58-0703 with the recommended technical changes
only, if any (i.e., no changes to comply with the latest versions of the Regulations, Procedure Manual, and Style Manual). I
R1-10.1 Color Codes — The use of color associated with the display of ARAMS (i.e., SEMI E10) equipment state
information is optional. To ensure consistency for the user, the following color schemes shall be applied for all cases
where color is associated with an ARAMS equipment state.
R1-10.1.1 Uptime Equipment States
• PRD: green
• SBY: yellow
• ENG: blue
R1-10.1.2 Downtime Equipment States
• SDT: light red
• UDT: red
R1-10.1.3 Other Equipment States
• NST: grey
R1-10.2 This scheme provides a visual grouping.
NOTE 35: The colors used for the two downtime states should be both clearly related and readily distinguishable, such as pink and
bright red.
R1-11 Reserved ARAMS Numerical/Text Codes for Equipment Substates
NOTE 36: This section reproduces the content contained in § 9 of SEMI E58-0703 with the recommended technical changes only,
if any (i.e., no changes to comply with the latest versions of the Regulations, Procedure Manual, and Style Manual).
R1-11.1 This section defines the format for ARAMS Substate Codes and a set of reserved values for generic substates
based on the descriptions in SEMI E10. The format is defined specifically to allow further resolution of the six basic
SEMI E10 equipment states by both the factory and equipment supplier.
R1-11.2 An ARAMS Substate Code consists of four ordered alphanumeric text characters, where the first two
characters are reserved digits. The first character indicates the primary ARAMS state as follows:

R1-11.7 Additional Codes — Additional codes may be defined by both the user and supplier, subject to the following
constraints: F
N
• The new code defines a refinement of a primary ARAMS state, as defined in § 9 of SEMI E58, through use of
I
the characters in the third and fourth positions.
• Alphabetic characters are permitted in the third and fourth positions. For purposes of sorting, these characters are
assumed to be case-sensitive. All characters other than alphanumeric are prohibited.
• The third character is used to differentiate between codes defined by the user (factory) and those defined by the
equipment supplier. If the third character is a digit, then the code is user defined. Otherwise, the code is supplier-
defined. The user is free to assign values between ‘01’ and ‘9z’ as the third and fourth characters, while the
supplier may assign values between ‘A0’ and ‘zz’.
NOTE 37: Additional reserved codes may be added to § 9.2 of SEMI E58 or in § R1-2.6.2.1 in this Document in the future.
R1-11.8 Code definitions are exchanged as ARAMS Substate Tables, described in SEMI E58 § 10.3.
R1-11.9 Valid ARAMS Substate Code — A valid ARAMS Substate Code is defined as any code with four
alphanumeric characters where the first character is a digit between 1 and 6 and the second character is a digit between
0 and 9.
R1-11.10 Manufacturing Code — A user request for the equipment to go to manufacturing specifies a special code
of ‘0000’. The code ‘0000’ is not itself an ARAMS Substate Code and shall not be used as a code representing the
current ARAMS state/substate in the variable ARAMSState.

R1-12 Introduction
L
R1-12.1 This Related Information section has been created in an effort to provide practical guidance to the industry A
on where to draw SEMI E10 productive time boundaries. This is accomplished by referencing SEMI Equipment N
Automation Standards equipment state models and identifying states in those Standards where SEMI E10 productive
O
time is active.

R1-13 SEMI E30 (GEM) Generic Equipment Model
A
R1-13.1 When comparing the SEMI E10 productive time equipment state (i.e., PRD) with the SEMI E30 processing
M
state model, SEMI E10 productive time can be said to contain all of the time from the SEMI E30 executing state. In
addition, the SEMI E10 productive time definition states that loading and unloading time is included, which also R
implies a mapping to a portion of the SEMI E30 setup state time. Figure R4-1 illustrates the SEMI E30 processing O
state model and the associated states that participate in time contribution to the SEMI E10 productive time statePRD.

T
R1-14.1 Relative to the SEMI E116 (EPT) equipment module states, PRD includes all time in ‘busy’ states during O
SEMI E10 manufacturing time where the SEMI E116 task type is either ‘process’ or ‘support.’ Figure R4-2 and Table
L
R4-1 from SEMI E116 illustrate the ‘busy’ state and the associated task types from the event variable definitions table.

Task Type The type of EPT Task currently Enumerated RO 0 = No Task
running on this EPT module. 1 = Unspecified
2 = Process - adding value (e.g.,

3 = Support - incapable of adding
value (e.g., Handling/Transport)
4 = Equipment Maintenance (e.g.,
equipment initiated clean cycle)
5 = Equipment Diagnostics (e.g.,
equipment-initiated health check)
6 = Waiting (e.g., chamber waiting

R1-15 SEMI E58 (ARAMS) Automated Reliability Availability Maintainability
R1-15.1 Since the SEMI E58 (ARAMS) Standard provided automated data collections support for an earlier version
of SEMI E10, the correlation for productive time is straightforward. Relative to SEMI E58, the SEMI E10 productive
time statePRD is intended to be synonymous with the ARAMS productive statePRD. Figure R4-3 is the SEMI E58
ARAMS state model depicting its version of the productive statePRD.
