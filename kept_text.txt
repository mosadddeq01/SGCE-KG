Terms and Glossary
In Short…
•฀ The Incoterms (International Commercial Terms), also known as terms of delivery, are the essential part of any export-import
transaction and standard trade definitions most commonly used in international sales contracts. Developed and administered
by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris.
•฀ United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) provides guidelines to promote the progressive harmoni-
zation and unification of the law of international trade to reduce divergences between trade laws of different states.
chapter 1 Incoterms
To avoid conflicts and difficulties, importers and exporters – or buyers and sellers – must have a
common understanding of the terms and conditions under which they trade. The latest issue was
released in 2000, and the mention of “Incoterms 2000” in a contract determines the obligations of
the buyer and the seller and greatly contributes towards eliminating causes of disagreement.
The complete text of Incoterms constitutes a book of its own, and it would be difficult to incorpo-
rate all of it into this guide. Only the most commonly used terminology will be examined, with
the respective obligations of seller and buyers given in a concise transcription.
Validity of incoterms
Incoterms apply only if incorporated in the contract of sale or if they are, for example, mentioned
in the offer, the sales conditions, the purchase order, the confirmation of an order or if they are
stipulated by the parties in separate agreement. Parties wishing to use Incoterms 2000 should
clearly specify that their contract is governed by Incoterms 2000. Incoterms do not apply directly
to questions relating to the transfer of ownership, property rights of the goods, breaches of con-
tract and its consequences, exclusions of liabilities in certain circumstances, limitation period
and conditions of payment. These should be clarified in the sales contract.
When do incoterms apply?
Validity of Incoterms apply only if incorporated in the contract of sale or if they are specified in
the solicitation document, mentioned in the offer, the sales conditions, the purchase order, the
confirmation of an order or if they are stipulated by the parties in separate agreement. Parties
wishing to use Incoterms 2000 should clearly specify that their solicitation document and the
contract are governed by Incoterms 2000.
The full text of Incoterms can be purchased from www.iccbooks.com. Note: The “ICC Guide to
Incoterms 2000” is recommended reading and it explains how Incoterms 2000 can work for you
in daily practice and provides practical answers to important and recurring questions.

the Structure of incoterms 2000
Incoterms 2000 are governed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris and are
grouped into four different categories. In Groups E and F the seller’s obligations are minimal and
the buyer must do most of the work and assume maximum risk. As we move to Group C the sup-
plier’s obligations become more extensive, however the buyer still assumes risks. As we move to
group D the supplier makes most arrangements and assumes maximum risk, whereas the buyer
must pay for and arrange import customs clearance and un-loading from the forwarder’s vehicle
at the final destination.
Group Description
E The seller only makes the goods available to the buyer at the seller’s premises.
F The seller delivers the goods to a carrier or place appointed by the buyer.
C The seller has to contract at his costs for carriage (and insurance for CIF and CIP).
D The seller must assume most costs, obligations and risks needed to bring the goods to the place of destination
(except import customs clearance and un-loading at the final destination).
The structure of Incoterms 2000
transfer of risks
Incoterms not only describe seller’s and the buyer’s obligations and specify the point when the
responsibilities for the transportation costs shift from the seller to the buyer; it also determines
the point when the risks associated with transportation transfer from the seller to the buyer.
EXW When the goods are at the disposal of the buyer
FCA When the goods have been delivered to the carrier at the named place
FAS When the goods have been placed alongside the ship
FOB When the goods pass the ship’s rail, at the port of export (origin)
CFR When the goods pass the ship’s rail, at the port of export (origin)
CIF When the goods pass the ship’s rail, at the port of export (origin)
CIP When the goods have been delivered to the main carrier, at the port of export (origin)
CPT When the goods have been delivered to the main carrier, at the port of export (origin)
DAF When the goods have been delivered to the carrier
DES When the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on board the ship
DEQ When the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the quay
DDU When the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer
DDP When the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer

transport Mode and their appropriate incoterms
Certain Incoterms are multi-modal and others can be used only when the goods are intended to
carried by sea or inland water transport. Since CFR and CIF can only be used when the goods
are intended for carriage by sea or inland waterway transport CPT and CIP respectively must
be used when whenever the goods are not handed over for marine transport or when the goods
are containerized (even the container is delivered to a seaport). A common mistake is selecting
the Incoterm which is not appropriate for the agreed mode of transport. The terms must be used
for the correct mode of transport if they are to offer any protection to the buyer or the seller.

Applicable Incoterms in different modes of transportation
the eight Most commonly used incoterms
In total there are 13 different Incoterms, however only the study of the 8 most commonly used
Incoterms are broadly described in this guide:
Ex Works (EXW)
Title and risk pass to buyer including payment of
Group Incoterm
all transportation and insurance costs from the
E Ex-works (EXW)
seller’s premises, and the seller assumes minimum
F Free Carrier (FCA)
risk. This is used for any mode of transportation.
The seller has fulfilled obligations when the goods Free on Board (FOB)
are placed at the disposal of the buyer. Loading at C Cost and Freight (CFR)
the supplier’s premises and export formalities are at Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)
the cost and risk of the buyer. However, if the seller
Carriage Paid to (CPT)
is required to assume the cost and risk of loading,
Carriage and Insurance Paid to (CIP)
the sentence “loaded upon the departing vehicle at
the cost and risk of the seller” must be added after D Delivered Duty Uncleared (DDU)
EXW in the purchase order. The 8 most commonly used Incoterms
This term should not be used if the buyer cannot carry out the export formalities, either directly
or indirectly, and in such cases the FCA term should be used.
ShiPPing and incOterMS / Practice guide 37
Seller must:
• Place the goods “at the disposal of the buyer” at the named place of delivery, at the agreed date
or within the period agreed;
• Must give the buyer sufficient notice and advise buyer of the availability of the goods;
• Provide suitable packing (unless otherwise stipulated in contract); and
• Help buyer to procure documents obtainable in the country and which may be required by the
buyer.
Buyer must:
• Take delivery as soon as goods are placed at the buyer’s disposal at the agreed time and loca-
tion;
• Clear the goods for export;
• Bear all risk and cost of goods from the moment they are placed at the buyer’s disposal;
• Bear cost and expense of obtaining documents required for buyer’s own use; and
• Load the goods onto the on-forwarding vehicle at the buyer’s own cost and risk.
Free on Board (FOB) Named Port of Shipment
“Free on Board” means that the seller delivers when the goods pass the ship’s rail at the named
port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to
the goods from that point. The FOB term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. This
term can be used only for sea or inland waterway transport. If the parties do not intend to deliver
across the ship’s rail, the FCA term should be used.
It is recommended that contracts do not quote only “FOB”, which is not clear and can lead to
many interpretations, but should specify the port of shipment.
For example, it is even preferable to request FOB UK port rather than FOB London, as it leaves
the opportunity to ship from another port if there is a convenient vessel at the same cost, or FOB
North Continental port, rather than FOB Hamburg or FOB Rotterdam, for the same reason. This
depends on the terms of offers received and can only be specified on contracts with the seller’s
agreement.
Seller must:
• Prepare and pack the goods as required;
• Deliver the goods on board the vessel designated by the contract;
• Bear all costs and all risks of the goods until they have effectively passed ship’s rail;
• Bear costs of counting, measuring, weighing;
• Provide when required, at the buyer’s expense, consular certified invoices, certificates of ori-
gin and help buyer to obtain other documents obtainable in the country and which the buyer
may need; and
• Provide the buyer at the seller’s expense with the usual document of proof of delivery.
Buyer must:
• At own expense, reserve space on board a vessel and give all the required instructions to the
seller enabling it to deliver in time for shipment (NOTE: this registration and calling forward
are normally carried out by the buyer’s forwarding agent.);
• Bear all expenses and risks of the goods from the time they have effectively passed ship’s
rail;
• Bear the cost of obtaining documents required for the export of the goods;
• Pay demurrage incurred at the port of shipment unless the detention is attributable to the
seller;
38 ShiPPing and incOterMS / Practice guide
• Bear any costs incurred if the vessel designated by the buyer or buyer’s agent is unable to take
the goods;
• Bear the cost of B/L and any documents the buyer may have asked the seller to provide; and
• Pay the cost of inspection, if required.
Free Carrier (FCA)
This term has been designed to meet the requirements of modern transport, particularly such
“multimodal” transport as container or “roll on-roll off” (RO/RO) traffic by trailers and ferries.
It is based on the same main principles as FOB except that the seller fulfils his obligations when
the goods are delivered into the custody of the carrier at the named point (and not loaded onto
any means of transport used for the main voyage).
“Free Carrier” means that the seller fulfills the obligation to deliver at the point when the goods
are handed over and cleared for export into the charge of the carrier named by the buyer at the
named place or point. If no precise point is indicated by the buyer, the seller may choose within
the place or range stipulated where the carrier shall take the goods into their charge. When, ac-
cording to commercial practice, the seller’s assistance is required in making the contract with the
carrier (such as in rail or air transport) the seller may act at the buyer’s risk and expense.
This term may be used for any mode of transport, including multimodal transport.
“Carrier” means any company who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure
the performance of carriage by rail, road, sea, air, inland waterway or by a combination of such
modes. If the buyer instructs the seller to deliver the cargo to a person, e.g. a freight forwarder
who is not a “carrier”, the seller is deemed to have fulfilled his obligation to deliver the goods
when they are in the custody of that company.
“Transport terminal” means a railway terminal, a freight station, a container terminal or yard, a
multi-purpose cargo terminal or any similar receiving point.
“Container” includes any equipment used to unitize cargo, e.g. all types of containers and/or flats, whether ISO accepted or not,
trailers swap bodies and RO/RO equipment, and applies to all modes of transport. In order to clarify the seller’s obligations as
regards delivery, we are quoting below the full text of the Incoterms 2000:
Delivery to the carrier is completed:
1. In the case of rail transport when the goods constitute a wagon load (or a container load carried by rail) the seller has to load
the wagon or container in the appropriate manner. Delivery is completed when the loaded wagon or container is taken over
by the railway or by another person acting on its behalf.
2. In the case of road transport when loading takes place at the seller’s premises, delivery is completed when the goods have
been loaded on the vehicle provided by the buyer. When the goods are delivered to a carrier’s premises, delivery is completed
when they have been handed over to the road carrier or to another person acting on this behalf.
3. In the case of transport by inland waterway when loading takes place at the seller’s premises, delivery is completed when the
goods have been loaded on the carrying vessel provided by the buyer. When the goods are delivered to the carrier’s premises,
delivery is completed when they have been handed over to the inland waterway carrier or to another person acting on this
behalf.
4. In the case of sea transport when the goods constitute a full container load (FCL), delivery is completed when the loaded
container is taken over by the sea carrier. Do not use FOB for containerized shipments, instead use FCA. When the container
has been carried to an operator of a transport terminal acting on behalf of the carrier, the goods shall be deemed to have been
taken over when the container has entered into the premises of that terminal.
5. In the case of air transport, delivery is completed when the goods have been handed over to the air carrier or to another
company acting on its behalf.
6. In the case of multimodal transport, delivery is completed when the goods have been handed over as specified in 1.-5., as the
case may be.

Cost and Freight (CFR) Port of Destination
Seller must:
• Contract and pay for the carriage of the goods to the port of destination on a sea-going vessel,
by the usual route unless otherwise stipulated in the contract of sale;
• Obtain and pay for a clean B/L (a through B/L) for the goods;
• Prepare and pack the goods as required;
• Bear the cost of checking, counting, weighing, measuring;
• Bear the cost of obtaining documents required for the export of the goods, and the cost of de-
murrage if any at the port of shipment;
• Bear all risks of the goods until they have passed ship’s rail at the port of shipment;
• Provide, at buyer’s expense, consular/certified invoices and/or certificates of origin and assist
in obtaining other documents upon request of the seller to procure;
• Notify the buyer without delay of the shipment; and
• Unless otherwise agreed, at seller’s own expense provide the buyer without delay with the
usual transport document for the agreed port of destination.
Buyer must:
• Bear all risks of the goods from the time they have passed the ship’s rail at the port of ship-
ment;
• Bear costs incurred in obtaining documents such as consular/certified invoices, etc. (not the
cost of B/L);
• Accept, as proof of payment of freight, B/L stamped “freight paid” or “freight prepaid”, and
arrange payment on receipt of documents in accordance with terms of contract, even before
actual arrival of goods at destinations;
• Bear the cost of unloading, lighterage, dock charges at destination, as well as all further ex-
penses such as customs clearance, duties and taxes, etc.;
• Except freight and bear extra expenses that may be incurred during the course of the carriage
by sea (by reason of emergencies, back freight, etc.); and
• Bear cost of inspection when inspection is required.
Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)
The respective duties of seller and buyer are the same as for CFR contracts, with the addition of
the insurance coverage. The additional obligations are the following:
Seller must:
• Contract at own expense with an insurance company, a transferable insurance coverage for the
risks, duration and journey specified in the contract of sale or accepted purchase order (NOTE:
it is advisable that buyer includes in the solicitation document and in the contract, a provision
for additional coverage at seller’s expense, i.e. Institute Cargo Clauses A); and
• Provide the insurance policy or certificate together with B/L and other documents, for the
buyer to receive them in time for collection of the goods upon arrival. NOTE: the seller buys
insurance on behalf of the buyer.
Buyer must:
• Bear supplementary expenses of insurance against risks requested that the seller cover, and
which were not included in the contract of sale; and
• Do their work in connection with an insurance claim.

Freight Carriage Paid (CPT) Named Point of Destination
The CPT term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. This term may be used for any
mode of transport including multimodal transport (i.e. including containers, roll-on/roll-off traf-
fic by trailers and ferries).
CPT can be used for any mode of transport, including containerized shipments delivered to a sea-
port. “CPT Cape Town” means that the seller pays the freight for the carriage of the goods to the
named destination, in this case Cape Town. The risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred
from the seller to the buyer when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the carrier
and not at ship’s rail. Risk passes from the seller to the buyer at so-called FCA point. If subsequent
carriers are used for the carriage to the agreed destination, the risk passes when the goods have
been delivered to the first carrier.
“Carrier” means any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure
the performance of carriage by rail, sea, road, air, inland waterway or by a combination of such
modes.
Freight Carriage and Insurance Paid (CIP) Named Point of Destination
“Carriage and insurance paid to …” means that the seller has the same obligations as under CPT
but with the addition that the seller has to procure cargo insurance against the buyer’s risk of loss
of or damage to the goods during the carriage. The seller contracts for insurance and pays the in-
surance premium. The buyer should note that under CIP term the seller is only required to obtain
insurance on minimum coverage. It is advisable that buyer includes in the solicitation document
and in the contract, a provision for additional coverage at seller’s expense, (i.e. Institute Cargo
Clauses A). The CIP term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. This term may be used
for any mode of transport including multimodal transport.
Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) Named Place of Destination
The seller clears the goods for export and is responsible for making the goods available (usually
in the buyer’s country) at the named point and place and on the date or period specified in the
sales contract but not unloaded from any arriving means of transport. DDU can be used on all
means of transport. The buyer bears the cost and risk of carrying out import customs formalities,
including the payment of formalities, customs duties, taxes and other charges (unless otherwise
specified in the contract). The seller’s business risk is high compared to the C terms above, be-
cause the seller bears the risk of loss during transit and may not invoice the buyer until delivery
at the final destination has taken place. However, the risk may pass even before the goods have
reached the agreed delivery point, for example, when the goods are detained at a customs station
because of the buyer’s failure to fulfil the obligation to clear the goods for import (thus the buyer
may bear the cost of any loss and demurrage charges during this time). Overall, the buyer’s risks
are minimized, but at a cost which is factored into the offered DDU price. Because of the risks
involved the supplier may, depending on the destination and other commercial considerations,
be reluctant to offer DDU delivery.
