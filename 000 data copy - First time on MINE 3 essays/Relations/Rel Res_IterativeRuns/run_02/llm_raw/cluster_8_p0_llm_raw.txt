Such membership is best modeled as a taxonomic hierarchy rather than pure IDENTITY. Aligning rel_cls_group to 'HIERARCHY' and using a more precise rel_cls 'taxonomic_instance_relation' keeps it consistent with the subtype taxonomic modeling used in RelR_8deeeec9c025 while preserving the existing canonical_rel_name 'is_instance_of'.",
