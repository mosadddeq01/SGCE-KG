They currently share the same canonical_rel_name 'is_about' but have slightly inconsistent canonical_rel_desc, rel_cls ('aboutness_relation' vs 'document_topic_relation'), and rel_cls_group ('ASSOCIATION' vs 'ABOUTNESS'). Unifying them under a single, precise description, a specific class 'document_topic_relation', and the broad group 'ABOUTNESS' yields a consistent schema for document–topic aboutness relations across these instances.",
