This is best modeled as a state-change / transformation (MODIFICATION) rather than as a direct causal relation between two independent entities. The existing rel_cls 'morphological_transformation_relation' is appropriate; only the broad group should be normalized from 'CAUSALITY' to 'MODIFICATION' to better reflect the semantics of change-of-form.",
