      "new_description": "Deprecated high-level aggregate for flowering plant reproduction. This class was previously used to bundle organisms (flowering plants), reproductive processes (pollination), and structures, but has been superseded by more specific classes: Plant Reproductive Structures, Pollination (Flowering Plant Process), and Flowering Plants (Organisms). It is retained only for backward compatibility and should not receive new members.",
      "new_class_type_hint": "Deprecated Aggregate",
      "new_class_group": "Flowering Plant Reproduction & Pollination",
      "remark": "This class has no members and its original scope is now cleanly covered by ClsC_fb0a1cd7 (Plant Reproductive Structures), ClsR_9ddc1c4b (Pollination (Flowering Plant Process)), and ClsR_2f847eb5 (Flowering Plants (Organisms)). Treat this as a deprecated aggregate container; avoid assigning new entities here and migrate any legacy members into the more specific classes.",
      "justification": "ClsC_e2aa4b5b is an empty, over-broad aggregate whose documented scope has been structurally split into three more precise classes; explicitly marking it as a deprecated aggregate within the same Class_Group avoids confusion and prevents future mis-assignment of entities.",
