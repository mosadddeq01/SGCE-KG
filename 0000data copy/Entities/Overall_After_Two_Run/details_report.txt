Final-entities summary (computed automatically)
============================================================
Final entities (count): 775
Derived from representative file: /home/mabolhas/MyReposOnSOL/SGCE-KG/data/Entities/Ent_2nd/Ent_2nd_Ouput/entities_raw_second_run.jsonl
 - canonical representatives: 277
 - singletons: 498
 - total original rows aggregated (sum of member_count): 986
 - avg members per final entity: 1.272258064516129

Why this count? (short explanation)
- The 'final entities' after two resolution runs is defined as the number of canonical representatives
  (each representing a merged group of original raw entities) PLUS the number of singletons (entities not merged).
- If a 'representative' file exists (one row per final entity), it's the cleanest source and is used directly.
- If only a resolved file exists (many original rows with canonical_id assignments), we compute the number of unique canonical_ids
  and add the rows without canonical_id (singletons).
- Differences from expectations can come from:
  * incomplete canonical records (some canonical groups may be recorded in separate canonical files)
  * inconsistencies in file naming/locations (your repo has multiple candidate paths; this script chooses the first match)
  * some resolved rows might still carry original ids or member lists; the script approximates member_count when possible.

If you want a different definition of 'final entity' (e.g., only canonical groups, or deduping by name), tell me and I will adapt the script.
