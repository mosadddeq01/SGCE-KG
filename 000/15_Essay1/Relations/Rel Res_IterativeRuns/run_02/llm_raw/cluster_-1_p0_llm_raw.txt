Updating the canonical_rel_name and description to focus on functional necessity and aligning rel_cls_group from COMPOSITION to CAUSALITY resolves this mismatch while keeping the ecological_role_relation class.",

In this instance, however, the object is the 'pupa stage' (a life stage), while the description clarifies that the chrysalis is the defining protective casing for that stage. This is more naturally modeled as a relation between a life stage and its characteristic structure, not generic spatial containment of a stage entity. Renaming to 'is_protective_casing_for_stage', refining the description, and assigning a more specific rel_cls 'life_stage_structure_relation' while retaining SPATIALITY (due to the enclosing spatial role) better capture the intended semantics.",
