Three instances already use the canonical_rel_name 'develops_into' with a consistent description and class. Two instances use a slightly different canonical_rel_name 'develops_into_next_life_stage' but with the same meaning and same rel_cls/group. Normalizing these two to 'develops_into' with the shared description makes the predicate schema consistent and reusable across all life stage transitions.",
