Generalizing the relation class from 'life_cycle_stage_order_relation' to 'developmental_stage_order_relation' makes the schema reusable for other species and developmental contexts while preserving the TEMPORALITY group and existing canonical_rel_name values ('precedes_in_life_cycle' and 'follows_in_life_cycle').",
