      "justification": "The first two relations both express that the butterfly species (subject) causally affects a life-history trait (egg traits or metamorphosis duration). Renaming the canonical predicate to 'species_influences_life_history_trait' makes the subject role explicit and aligns the two instances under a single, clearer predicate while remaining within the same dependency class and CAUSALITY group. The third relation legitimately uses a complementary direction (trait depends on species) and should keep its distinct canonical name.",
