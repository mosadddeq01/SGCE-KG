The instance description and qualifiers emphasize that adult butterflies *visit* flowers in the context of feeding on nectar (VisitPurpose: feeding on nectar), with flowers acting as the feeding site. Renaming to 'visits_feeding_site' better captures that the predicate is about visiting a location used for feeding, while remaining within the same interaction and feeding_interaction_relation class.",
