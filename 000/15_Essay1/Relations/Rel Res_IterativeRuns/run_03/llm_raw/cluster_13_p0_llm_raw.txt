They should therefore share a single generic predicate 'enables' rather than mixing a generic form with a highly specific 'enables_reproduction_of'. The broader class 'enabling_relation' is more appropriate than splitting into 'biological_capability_relation' vs 'biological_causal_effect_relation', and both fit naturally under the CAUSALITY group since functional enablement is a causal notion.",
