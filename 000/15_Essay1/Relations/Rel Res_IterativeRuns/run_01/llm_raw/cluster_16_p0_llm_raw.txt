They are semantically equivalent and should share a single canonical predicate. Using 'undergoes_biological_process' standardizes the label across instances. The broader class 'biological_process_participation_relation' is appropriate for both, and the group 'AGENCY' better reflects organismal participation than the previous 'ASSOCIATION' used for one instance.",
