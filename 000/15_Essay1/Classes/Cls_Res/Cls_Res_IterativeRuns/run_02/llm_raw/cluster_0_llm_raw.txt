      "remark": "Previously separate process vs structure subclasses (ClsR_fc192048, ClsR_703dd4b2) have been merged with the umbrella class (ClsC_414056f3) because the current schema does not support explicit subclassing and the distinctions were not used elsewhere; if future ontology layers support subtyping, this class could be re-factored into process/structure children.",
