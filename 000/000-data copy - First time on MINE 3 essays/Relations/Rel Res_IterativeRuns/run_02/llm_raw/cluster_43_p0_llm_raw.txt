      "justification": "Both relations state that the adult butterfly stage is characterized by specific behaviors (mating/reproduction). This expresses a defining behavioral characteristic rather than an agentive action, so they should share a single predicate emphasizing characterization, not agency. Normalizing to 'characterized_by_behavior' with a behavioral characteristic class and ATTRIBUTE group makes the schema consistent and avoids redundant variants ('exhibits_behavior' vs 'has_characteristic_behavior').",
