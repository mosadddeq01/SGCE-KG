Normalizing to 'used_for_feeding' gives a reusable, predicate-style label that still matches the instance semantics (proboscis used to feed on nectar) without baking in the object. The description is updated to stay consistent with the more general predicate while still mentioning nectar as an example. The relation class and group are already appropriate and do not need changes.",
