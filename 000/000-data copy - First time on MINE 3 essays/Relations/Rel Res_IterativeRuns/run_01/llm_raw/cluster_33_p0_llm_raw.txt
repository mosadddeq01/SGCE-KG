      "justification": "All these relations describe a causal enabling or facilitation of the spread/dissemination of stories or urban legends by some medium, process, or technology. They are currently split across two very similar canonical names (\"facilitates_spread_of\" vs. \"facilitates_dissemination_of\") and two near-duplicate classes (\"information_dissemination_enabler_relation\" vs. \"dissemination_facilitation_relation\"), and one instance (RelR_4339d7a83acf) is misaligned in rel_cls_group (DISSEMINATION instead of CAUSALITY) despite clearly encoding a causal facilitation. Normalizing them to a single canonical predicate, a single facilitation-oriented rel_cls, and a CAUSALITY rel_cls_group yields a cleaner and more consistent KG schema for all causal dissemination-enabler edges.",
      "remark": "This normalization intentionally treats all media/process/technology factors that enable or speed up story/legend spread as instances of the same causal dissemination-facilitation predicate family.",
