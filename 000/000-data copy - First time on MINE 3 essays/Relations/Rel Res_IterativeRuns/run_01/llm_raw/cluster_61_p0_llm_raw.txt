They already share the same canonical predicate 'contributes_to' and rel_cls_group 'CAUSALITY'. Unifying the rel_cls to 'ecosystem_function_relation' and harmonizing the canonical_rel_desc with the broader ecosystem-function wording used in the second relation creates a consistent schema for this predicate while still covering role-level and organism-level contributions.",
