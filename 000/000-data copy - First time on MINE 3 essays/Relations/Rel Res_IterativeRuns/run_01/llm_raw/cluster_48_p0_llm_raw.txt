      "justification": "Both relations link human or cultural groups to enduring psychological or sociocultural traits (imagination, culturally specific fears). They share the same semantic pattern and should use a unified predicate and relation class. Normalizing to 'has_characteristic' avoids trivial variation with 'has_attribute', and using a single rel_cls 'psychological_cultural_attribute_relation' captures that these are not generic physical attributes but mental/cultural characteristics. The rel_cls_group is aligned to the core dimension 'ATTRIBUTE', replacing the slightly inconsistent 'ATTRIBUTION' label.",
