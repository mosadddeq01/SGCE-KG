      "new_description": "Deprecated umbrella class that formerly grouped caterpillar growth and molting processes. All known entities have been moved into more specific subclasses (e.g., Caterpillar Rapid Growth, Caterpillar Molting Process). This class is retained only for backward compatibility and should not be used for new annotations.",
