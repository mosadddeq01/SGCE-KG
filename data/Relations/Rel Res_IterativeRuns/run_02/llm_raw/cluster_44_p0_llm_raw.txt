The current canonical_rel_name values ('performs_activity' vs. 'performs_biological_process') and rel_cls values ('agent_activity_participation_relation' vs. 'biological_process_participation_relation') are overly fragmented for the same participation semantics. Normalizing to 'participates_in_process_or_activity' with a unified class 'process_or_activity_participation_relation' captures both events and biological processes consistently, while the existing rel_cls_group 'PARTICIPATION' remains appropriate and does not need overriding.",
