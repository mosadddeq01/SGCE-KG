Relation RelR_53b3fc460723 already uses the more precise predicate 'is_problematic_state_of' with class 'data_quality_issue_relation' and group 'QUALITY'. For consistency and to better reflect that this is a data quality state rather than a pure taxonomic subtype, RelR_28d2994fd29a should be aligned to the same canonical predicate, class, and group.",
