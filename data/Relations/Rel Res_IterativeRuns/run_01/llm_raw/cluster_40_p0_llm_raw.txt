      "justification": "The relation 'is_life_stage_of' captures a membership/identity relation between a specific life stage and its organism, rather than a temporal ordering between two stages. It expresses that the pupa is an inherent life stage of the butterfly (a role/phase within the organism's identity and life history), not that it occurs before or after a particular stage. Therefore, mapping this to the broad group IDENTITY is more accurate than TEMPORALITY, which is better reserved for explicit ordering relations like 'precedes'.",
