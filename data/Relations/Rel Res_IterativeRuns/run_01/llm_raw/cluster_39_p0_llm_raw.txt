      "justification": "For these two relations, the subject is the general organism type 'butterfly' and the object is a life stage type (e.g., 'adult stage of a butterfly', 'pupa stage of the butterfly life cycle'). The existing canonical_rel_name 'in_life_stage' and its description imply an individual currently being in a specific life stage, which does not match the taxon-to-stage-type semantics here. A more accurate predicate is 'has_life_cycle_stage_type', which captures that the organism's life cycle includes that stage type, while keeping them in the same life_stage_membership_relation class and TEMPORALITY group as the reverse-direction predicates.",
