The previous predicate name ('influences_fairness_outcome') fit the first relation but was slightly misaligned with the second, whose object is 'equity'. Normalizing to 'influences_fairness_and_equity_outcomes' yields a single, accurate canonical predicate for both while preserving the existing relation class and causal grouping.",
