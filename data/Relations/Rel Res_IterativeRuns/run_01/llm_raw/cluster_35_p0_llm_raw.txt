      "justification": "Both relations describe phenomena (urban legend proliferation, biased algorithms) occurring within broader societal or procedural contexts (modern society, hiring processes). This is contextual rather than purely spatial or generic association, so they should share a single contextual-occurrence predicate ('occurs_in_context_of'), a unified relation class, and a rel_cls_group that reflects contextual embedding instead of SPATIALITY or ASSOCIATION.",
