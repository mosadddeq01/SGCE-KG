The canonical predicate 'lures' is appropriate but its description can be slightly clarified to highlight its role in enabling subsequent actions. The rel_cls is updated to 'enticement_relation' to align with the more domain-independent pattern used by the other relations, while keeping the broad group as CAUSALITY.",
