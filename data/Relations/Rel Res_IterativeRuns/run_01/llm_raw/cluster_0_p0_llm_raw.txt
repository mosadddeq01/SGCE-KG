      "justification": "The relation schema (canonical_rel_name, rel_cls, rel_cls_group) is consistent, but the object_class_label appears semantically narrower than the entity name 'general corrosion'. This potential mismatch is at the entity level and cannot be fixed here, so it is flagged for later review.",
