This is a clear case of causal inhibition of a metallurgical degradation process by an alloying element. Using the canonical predicate 'inhibits' generalizes beyond this specific case while preserving the inhibitory/preventive meaning. The relation class is therefore set to a process-level inhibition type under the broad causal group.",
