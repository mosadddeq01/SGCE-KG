      "justification": "All relations use the predicate 'occurs_in' and describe the presence or occurrence of a structure, phase, cracking mechanism, or degradation product within a specific steel or alloy type (e.g., austenitic phase in stainless steels, ferritic phase in duplex, HIC in low alloy steel, graphitization and graphite nodules in susceptible steels). Despite differing subjects (structures, mechanisms, products), the semantic pattern is consistent: an entity is present or observed in a material context. A shared canonical name 'occurs_in' with a generalized description and a common class 'material_occurrence_relation' under the broad SPATIALITY group captures this pattern without overfitting to any single subtype.",
      "remark": "Cluster covers both microstructural phases and damage/degradation phenomena but all follow the same material-occurrence pattern; qualifiers retain specifics such as conditions and causal hints.",
