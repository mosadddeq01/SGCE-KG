    "text": "3.1 Terms\n3.1.1 Austenitic – a term that refers to a type of metallurgical structure (austenite) normally found in 300\nSeries stainless steels and nickel base alloys.\n3.1.2 Austenitic stainless steels – the 300 Series stainless steels including Types 304, 304L, 304H,\n309, 310, 316, 316L, 316H, 321, 321H, 347, and 347H. The “L” and “H” suffixes refer to controlled ranges of\nlow and high carbon content, respectively. These alloys are characterized by an austenitic structure.\n3.1.3 Carbon steel – steels that do not have alloying elements intentionally added. However, there may\nbe small amounts of elements permitted by specifications such as SA516 and SA106, for example that can\naffect corrosion resistance, hardness after welding, and toughness. Elements which may be found in small\nquantities include Cr, Ni, Mo, Cu, S, Si, P, Al, V and B.\n3.1.4 Diethanolamine (DEA) – used in amine treating to remove H S and CO from hydrocarbon streams.\n2 2\n3.1.5 Duplex stainless steel – a family of stainless steels that contain a mixed austenitic-ferritic structure\nincluding Alloy 2205, 2304, and 2507. The welds of 300 series stainless steels may also exhibit a duplex\nstructure.\n3.1.6 Ferritic – a term that refers to a type of metallurgical structure (ferrite) normally found in carbon and\nlow alloy steels and many 400 series stainless steels.\n3.1.7 Ferritic stainless steels – include Types 405, 409, 430, 442, and 446.\n3.1.8 Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) – the portion of the base metal adjacent to a weld which has not been\nmelted, but whose metallurgical microstructure and mechanical properties have been changed by the heat of\nwelding, sometimes with undesirable effects.\n3.1.9 Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC) – describes stepwise internal cracks that connect adjacent\nhydrogen blisters on different planes in the metal, or to the metal surface. No externally applied stress is\nneeded for the formation of HIC. The development of internal cracks (sometimes referred to as blister\ncracks) tends to link with other cracks by a transgranular plastic shear mechanism because of internal\npressure resulting from the accumulation of hydrogen. The link-up of these cracks on different planes in\nsteels has been referred to as stepwise cracking to characterize the nature of the crack appearance.\n3.1.10 Low alloy steel – a family of steels containing up to 9% chromium and other alloying additions for\nhigh temperature strength and creep resistance. The materials include C-0.5Mo, Mn-0.5Mo, 1Cr-0.5Mo,\n1.25 Cr-0.5Mo, 2.25Cr-1.0Mo, 5Cr-0.5Mo, and 9Cr-1Mo. These are considered ferritic steels.\n3.1.11 Martensitic – a term that refers to a type of metallurgical structure (martensite) normally found in\nsome 400 series stainless steel. Heat treatment and or welding followed by rapid cooling can produce this\nstructure in carbon and low alloy steels.\n3.1.12 Martensitic stainless steel – include Types 410, 410S, 416, 420, 440A, 440B, and 440C.\n3.1.13 Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) – used in amine treating to remove H S and CO from hydrocarbon\n2 2\nstreams.\n3.1.14 Monoethanolamine (MEA) – used in amine treating to remove H S and CO from hydrocarbon\n2 2\nstreams.\n3.1.15 Nickel base – a family of alloys containing nickel as a major alloying element (>30%) including\nAlloys 200, 400, K-500, 800, 800H, 825, 600, 600H, 617, 625, 718, X-750, and C276.\n3.1.16 Stress oriented hydrogen induced cracking (SOHIC) – describes an array of cracks, aligned\nnearly perpendicular to the stress, that are formed by the link-up of small HIC cracks in steel. Tensile\nstrength (residual or applied) is required to produce SOHIC. SOHIC is commonly observed in the base metal\nadjacent to the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) of a weld, oriented in the through-thickness direction. SOHIC may\nalso be produced in susceptible steels at other high stress points, such as from the tip of the mechanical\ncracks and defects, or from the interaction among HIC on different planes in the steel.\n3.1.17 Stainless steel – there are four categories of stainless steels that are characterized by their\nmetallurgical structure at room temperature: austenitic, ferritic, martensitic and duplex. These alloys have\nvarying amounts of chromium and other alloying elements that give them resistance to oxidation, sulfidation\nand other forms of corrosion depending on the alloy content.\n3.2 Symbols and Abbreviations\n3.2.1 ACFM – alternating current magnetic flux leakage testing.\n3.2.2 AE – acoustic emission.\n3.2.3 AET – acoustic emission testing.\n3.2.4 AGO – atmospheric gas oil.\n3.2.5 AUBT – automated ultrasonic backscatter testing.\n3.2.6 BFW – boiler feed water.\n3.2.7 C – chemical symbol referring to ethane or ethylene.\n2\n3.2.8 C – chemical symbol referring to propane or propylene.\n3\n3.2.9 C – chemical symbol referring to butane or butylenes.\n4\n3.2.10 Cat – catalyst or catalytic.\n3.2.11 CDU – crude distillation unit.\n3.2.12 CH – methane.\n4\n3.2.13 CO – carbon monoxide.\n3.2.14 CO – carbon dioxide.\n2\n3.2.15 CVN – charpy v-notch.\n3.2.16 CW – cooling water.\n3.2.17 DIB – deisobutanizer.\n3.2.18 DNB – Departure from Nucleate Boiling.\n3.2.19 DEA – diethanolamine, used in amine treating to remove H S and CO from hydrocarbon streams.\n2 2\n3.2.20 EC – eddy current, test method applies primarily to non-ferromagnetic materials.\n3.2.21 FCC – fluid catalytic cracker.\n3.2.22 FMR – field metallographic replication.\n3.2.23 H – hydrogen.\n2\n3.2.24 H O – also known as water.\n2\n3.2.25 H S – hydrogen sulfide, a poisonous gas.\n2\n3.2.26 HAZ – Heat Affected Zone\n3.2.27 HB – Brinnell hardness number.\n3.2.28 HCO – heavy cycle oil.\n3.2.29 HCGO – heavy coker gas oil.\n3.2.30 HIC – Hydrogen Induced Cracking\n3.2.31 HP – high pressure.\n3.2.32 HPS – high pressure separator.\n3.2.33 HVGO – heavy vacuum gas oil.\n3.2.34 HSLA – high strength low alloy.\n3.2.35 HSAS – heat stable amine salts.\n3.2.36 IC – chemical symbol referring isobutane.\n4\n3.2.37 IP – intermediate pressure.\n3.2.38 IRIS – internal rotating inspection system.\n3.2.39 K.O. – knock out, as in K.O.

    "text": "4.2 Mechanical and Metallurgical Failure Mechanisms\n4.2.1 Graphitization\n4.2.1.1 Description of Damage\na) Graphitization is a change in the microstructure of certain carbon steels and 0.5Mo steels after long-term\noperation in the 800oF to 1100oF (427oC to 593oC) range that may cause a loss in strength, ductility,\nand/or creep resistance.\nb) At elevated temperatures, the carbide phases in these steels are unstable and may decompose into\ngraphite nodules. This decomposition is known as graphitization.\n4.2.1.2 Affected Materials\nSome grades of carbon steel and 0.5Mo steels.\n4.2.1.3 Critical Factors\na) The most important factors that affect graphitization are the chemistry, stress, temperature, and time of\nexposure.\nb) In general, graphitization is not commonly observed. Some steels are much more susceptible to\ngraphitization than others, but exactly what causes some steels to graphitize while others are resistant is\nnot well understood. It was originally thought that silicon and aluminum content played a major role but it\nhas been shown that they have negligible influence on graphitization.\nc) Graphitization has been found in low alloy C-Mo steels with up to 1% Mo. The addition of about 0.7%\nchromium has been found to eliminate graphitization.\nd) Temperature has an important effect on the rate of graphitization. Below 800oF (427oC), the rate is\nextremely slow. The rate increases with increasing temperature.\ne) There are two general types of graphitization. First is random graphitization in which the graphite\nnodules are distributed randomly throughout the steel. While this type of graphitization may lower the\nroom-temperature tensile strength some, it does not usually lower the creep resistance.\nf) The second and more damaging type of graphitization results in chains or local planes of concentrated\ngraphite nodules. This form of graphitization can result in a significant reduction in load bearing capacity\nwhile increasing the potential for brittle fracture along this plane. The two forms of this graphitization are\nweld heat affected zone graphitization and non-weld graphitization.\ni) Weld heat affected zone graphitization is most frequently found in the heat-affected zone adjacent\nto welds in a narrow band, corresponding to the low temperature edge of the heat affected zone.\nIn multipass welded butt joints, these zones overlap each other, covering the entire cross-section.\nGraphite nodules can form at the low temperature edge of these heat affected zones, resulting in a\nband of weak graphite extending across the section. Because of its appearance, this graphite\nformation within heat affected zones is called eyebrow graphitization.\n4-2 API Recommended Practice 571 December 2003\nii) Non-weld graphitization is a form of localized graphitization that sometimes occurs along planes of\nlocalized yielding in steel. It also occurs in a chain-like manner in regions that have experienced\nsignificant plastic deformation as a result of cold working operations or bending.\ng) The extent and degree of graphitization is usually reported in a qualitative fashion (none, slight,\nmoderate, severe). Although it is difficult to predict the rate at which it forms, severe heat affected zone\ngraphitization can develop in as little as 5 years at service temperatures above 1000oF (538oC). Very\nslight graphitization would be expected to be found after 30 to 40 years at 850oF (454oC). Time-\nTemperature-Transformation curves for heat affected zone graphitization can be found in Reference 2.\n4.2.1.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Primarily hot-wall piping and equipment in the FCC, catalytic reforming and coker units.\nb) Bainitic grades are less susceptible than coarse pearlitic grades.\nc) Few failures directly attributable to graphitization have been reported in the refining industry. However,\ngraphitization has been found where failure resulted primarily from other causes. Several serious cases\nof graphitization have occurred in the reactors and piping of fluid catalytic cracking units, as well as with\ncarbon steel furnace tubes in a thermal cracking unit and the failure of seal welds at the bottom tube\nsheet of the vertical boiler in a fluid catalytic cracker waste heat boiler. A graphitization failure was\nreported on a C-0.5Mo catalytic reformer reactor/interheater line long seam weld.\nd) Where concentrated eyebrow graphitization occurs along heat affected zones, the creep rupture strength\nmay be drastically lowered. Slight to moderate amounts of graphite along the heat-affected zones do not\nappear to significantly lower room or high-temperature properties.\ne) Graphitization seldom occurs on boiling surface tubing but did occur in low alloy C-0.5Mo tubes and\nheaders during the 1940’s. Economizer tubing, steam piping and other equipment that operates in the\nrange of temperatures of 850oF to 1025oF (441oC to 552oC) is more likely to suffer graphitization.\n4.2.1.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Damage due to graphitization is not visible or readily apparent and can only be observed by\nmetallographic examination (Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2).\nb) Advanced stages of damage related to loss in creep strength may include microfissuring/microvoid\nformation, subsurface cracking or surface connected cracking.\n4.2.1.6 Prevention / Mitigation\nGraphitization can be prevented by using chromium containing low alloy steels for long-term operation above\n800oF (427 oC).\n4.2.1.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Evidence of graphitization is most effectively evaluated through removal of full thickness samples for\nexamination using metallographic techniques. Damage may occur midwall so that field replicas may be\ninadequate.\nb) Advanced stages of damage related to loss in strength include surface breaking cracks or creep\ndeformation that may be difficult to detect.\n4.2.1.8 Related Mechanisms\nSpheroidization (see 4.2.2) and graphitization are competing mechanisms that occur at overlapping\ntemperature ranges. Spheroidization tends to occur preferentially above 1025oF (551oC), while graphitization\npredominates below this temperature.\n4.2.1.9 References\n1. H.

    "start_page": 34,
    "end_page": 37,
    "text": "4.2.3 Temper Embrittlement\n4.2.3.1 Description of Damage\nTemper embrittlement is the reduction in toughness due to a metallurgical change that can occur in some low\nalloy steels as a result of long term exposure in the temperature range of about 650oF to 1100oF (343oC to\n593oC) . This change causes an upward shift in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature as measured by\nCharpy impact testing. Although the loss of toughness is not evident at operating temperature, equipment\nthat is temper embrittled may be susceptible to brittle fracture during start-up and shutdown.\n4.2.3.2 Affected Materials\na) Primarily 2.25Cr-1Mo low alloy steel, 3Cr-1Mo (to a lesser extent), and the high-strength low alloy Cr-\nMo-V rotor steels.\nb) Older generation 2.25Cr-1Mo materials manufactured prior to 1972 may be particularly\nsusceptible.Some high strength low alloy steels are also susceptible.\nc) The C-0.5Mo and 1.25Cr-0.5Mo alloy steels are not significantly affected by temper embrittlement.\nHowever, other high temperature damage mechanisms promote metallurgical changes that can alter the\ntoughness or high temperature ductility of these materials.\n4.2.3.3 Critical Factors\na) Alloy steel composition, thermal history, metal temperature and exposure time are critical factors.\nb) Susceptibility to temper embrittlement is largely determined by the presence of the alloying elements\nmanganese and silicon, and the tramp elements phosphorus, tin, antimony, and arsenic. The strength\nlevel and heat treatment/fabrication history should also be considered.\nc) Temper embrittlement of 2.25Cr-1Mo steels develops more quickly at 900oF (482oC) than in the 800oF to\n850oF (427oC to 440oC) range, but the damage is more severe after long-term exposure at 850oF\n(440oC).\nd) Some embrittlement can occur during fabrication heat treatments, but most of the damage occurs over\nmany years of service in the embrittling temperature range.\ne) This form of damage will significantly reduce the structural integrity of a component containing a crack-\nlike flaw. An evaluation of the materials toughness may be required depending on the flaw type, the\nseverity of the environment, and the operating conditions, particularly in hydrogen service.\n4.2.3.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Temper embrittlement occurs in a variety of process units after long term exposure to temperatures\nabove 650oF (343oC). It should be noted that there have been very few industry failures related directly\nto temper embrittlement.\nb) Equipment susceptible to temper embrittlement is most often found in hydroprocessing units, particularly\nreactors, hot feed/effluent exchanger components, and hot HP separators. Other units with the potential\nfor temper embrittlement include catalytic reforming units (reactors and exchangers), FCC reactors,\ncoker and visbreaking units.\nc) Welds in these alloys are often more susceptible than the base metal and should be evaluated.\n4.2.3.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Temper embrittlement is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent and can be confirmed\nthrough impact testing. Damage due to temper embrittlement may result in catastrophic brittle fracture.\nb) Temper embrittlement can be identified by an upward shift in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature\nmeasured in a Charpy V-notch impact test, as compared to the non-embrittled or de-embrittled material\n(Figure 4-5). Another important characteristic of temper embrittlement is that there is no effect on the\nupper shelf energy.\n4.2.3.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) Existing Materials\ni) Temper embrittlement cannot be prevented if the material contains critical levels of the embrittling\nimpurity elements and is exposed in the embrittling temperature range.\nii) To minimize the possibility of brittle fracture during startup and shutdown, many refiners use a\npressurization sequence to limit system pressure to about 25 percent of the maximum design\npressure for temperatures below a Minimum Pressurization Temperature (MPT).\niii) MPT’s generally range from 350oF (171oC) for the earliest, most highly temper embrittled steels,\ndown to 150oF (38oC) or lower for newer, temper embrittlement resistant steels (as required to also\nminimize effects of hydrogen embrittlement).\niv) If weld repairs are required, the effects of temper embrittlement can be temporarily reversed (de-\nembrittled) by heating at 1150°F (620°C) for 2 hours per inch of thickness, and rapidly cooling to\nroom temperature. It is important to note that re-embrittlement will occur over time if the material is\nre-exposed to the embrittling temperature range.\nb) New Materials\ni) The best way to minimize the likelihood and extent of temper embrittlement is to limit the\nacceptance levels of manganese, silicon, phosphorus, tin, antimony, and arsenic in the base metal\nand welding consumables. In addition, strength levels and PWHT procedures should be specified\nand carefully controlled.\nii) A common way to minimize temper embrittlement is to limit the \"J*\" Factor for base metal and the\n\"X\" Factor for weld metal, based on material composition as follows:\nJ* = (Si + Mn) x (P + Sn) x 104 {elements in wt%}\nX =(10P + 5Sb + 4Sn + As)/100 {elements in ppm}\niii) Typical J* and X factors used for 2.25 Cr steel are 100 and 15, respectively. Studies have also\nshown that limiting the (P + Sn) to less than 0.01% is sufficient to minimize temper embrittlement\nbecause (Si + Mn) control the rate of embrittlement.\niv) Expert metallurgical advice should be solicited to determine acceptable composition, toughness\nand strength levels, as well as appropriate welding, fabricating and heat treating procedures for\nnew low alloy steel heavy wall equipment and low alloy equipment operating in the creep range.\n4.2.3.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) A common method of monitoring is to install blocks of original heats of the alloy steel material inside the\nreactor. Samples are periodically removed from these blocks for impact testing to monitor progress of\ntemper embrittlement or until a major repair issue arises.\nb) Process conditions should be monitored to ensure that a proper pressurization sequence is followed to\nhelp prevent brittle fracture due to temper embrittlement.\n4.2.3.8 Related Mechanisms\nNot applicable.\n4.2.3.9 References\n1.

    "text": "4.2.4 Strain Aging\n4.2.4.1 Description of Damage\nStrain aging is a form of damage found mostly in older vintage carbon steels and C-0.5 Mo low alloy steels\nunder the combined effects of deformation and aging at an intermediate temperature. This results in an\nincrease in hardness and strength with a reduction in ductility and toughness.\n4.2.4.2 Affected Materials\nMostly older (pre-1980’s) carbon steels with a large grain size and C-0.5 Mo low alloy steel.\n4.2.4.3 Critical Factors\na) Steel composition and manufacturing process determine steel susceptibility.\nb) Steels manufactured by the Bessemer or open hearth process contain higher levels of critical impurity\nelements than newer steels manufactured by the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) process.\nc) In general, steels made by BOF and fully killed with aluminum will not be susceptible. The effect is found\nin rimmed and capped steels with higher levels of nitrogen and carbon, but not in the modern fully killed\ncarbon steels manufactured to a fine grain practice.\nd) Strain aging effects are observed in materials that have been cold worked and placed into service at\nintermediate temperatures without stress relieving.\ne) Strain aging is a major concern for equipment that contains cracks. If susceptible materials are\nplastically deformed and exposed to intermediate temperatures, the zone of deformed material may\nbecome hardened and less ductile. This phenomenon has been associated with several vessels that\nhave failed by brittle fracture.\nf) The pressurization sequence versus temperature is a critical issue to prevent brittle fracture of\nsusceptible materials.\ng) Strain aging can also occur when welding in the vicinity of cracks and notches in a susceptible material.\n4.2.4.4 Affected Units or Equipment\nStrain aging is most likely to occur in wall vessels manufactured from susceptible materials that have not\nbeen stress relieved.\n4.2.4.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\nStrain aging can result in the formation of brittle cracks that are revealed through detailed metallurgical\nanalyses, but damage most likely will not be identified as strain aging until fracture has already occurred.\n4.2.4.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) Strain aging is not an issue for newer steels that contain low levels of interstitial impurity elements and\nsufficient aluminum (>0.015 wt%) to fully deoxidize the steel.\nb) For older equipment, extra care should be taken to avoid the potentially damaging effects of strain aging\nby avoiding stressing or pressurizing equipment until the metal temperature reaches an acceptable level\nwhere the risk of brittle fracture is low. Refer to curve “A” in UCS 66 of the ASME Code Section VIII,\nDivision I for pressurization temperatures of vessels susceptible to strain aging effects.\nc) Applying PWHT to weld repairs of susceptible materials will eliminate the effects of strain aging. Where\nPWHT is not possible, buttering should be considered to minimize welding on old material under\nrestraint.\n4.2.4.7 Inspection and Monitoring\nInspection and monitoring are not used to control strain aging.\n4.2.4.8 Related Mechanisms\nWhen deformation occurs at the intermediate temperature, the mechanism is referred to as dynamic strain\naging. Blue brittleness is another form of strain aging.\n4.2.4.9 References\n1. ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division I, American Society of Mechanical\nEngineers, NY.",

    "text": "4.2.5 885°F (475 oC) Embrittlement\n4.2.5.1 Description of Damage\n885°F (475°C) embrittlement is a loss in toughness due to a metallurgical change that can occur in alloys\ncontaining a ferrite phase, as a result of exposure in the temperature range 600oF to 1000oF (316oC to\n540oC).\n4.2.5.2 Affected Materials\na) 400 Series SS (e.g., 405, 409, 410, 410S, 430, and 446).\nb) Duplex stainless steels such as Alloys 2205, 2304, and 2507.\nc) Wrought and cast 300 Series SS containing ferrite, particularly welds and weld overlay.\n4.2.5.3 Critical Factors\na) The alloy composition, particularly chromium content, amount of ferrite phase, and operating\ntemperature are critical factors.\nb) Increasing amounts of ferrite phase increase susceptibility to damage when operating in the high\ntemperature range of concern. A dramatic increase in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature will\noccur.\nc) A primary consideration is operating time at temperature within the critical temperature range. Damage\nis cumulative and results from the precipitation of an embrittling intermetallic phase that occurs most\nreadily at approximately 885oF (475oC). Additional time is required to reach maximum embrittlement at\ntemperatures above or below 885oF (475oC). For example, many thousands of hours may be required to\ncause embrittlement at 600°F (316oC).\nd) Since 885oF embrittlement can occur in a relatively short period of time, it is often assumed that\nsusceptible materials that have been exposed to temperatures in the 700oF to 1000oF (371oC to 538oC)\nrange are affected.\ne) The effect on toughness is not pronounced at the operating temperature, but is significant at lower\ntemperatures experienced during plant shutdowns, startups or upsets.\nf) Embrittlement can result from tempering at higher temperatures or by holding within or cooling through\nthe transformation range.\n4.2.5.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) 885oF embrittlement can be found in any unit where susceptible alloys are exposed to the embrittling\ntemperature range.\nb) Most refining companies limit the use of ferritic stainless steels to non-pressure boundary applications\nbecause of this damage mechanism.\nc) Common examples include fractionator trays and internals in high temperature vessels used in FCC,\ncrude, vacuum and coker units. Typical failures include cracking when attempting to weld or to\nstraighten bent, upset tower trays of Type 409 and 410 material (occurs often with vacuum tower trays of\nthis material).\nd) Other examples include duplex stainless steel heat exchanger tubes and other components exposed to\ntemperatures above 600oF (316oC) for extended time periods.\n4.2.5.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) 885oF embrittlement is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent with metallography but can be\nconfirmed through bend or and impact testing.\nb) The existence of 885oF embrittlement can be identified by an increase in hardness in affected areas.\nFailure during bend testing or impact testing of samples removed from service is the most positive\nindicator of 885oF embrittlement.\n4.2.5.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) The best way to prevent 885oF embrittlement is to use low ferrite or non-ferritic alloys, or to avoid\nexposing the susceptible material to the embrittling range.\nb) It is possible to minimize the effects of embrittlement through modifications in the chemical composition\nof the alloy, however, resistant material may not always be readily available in most commercial forms.\nc) 885oF embrittlement is reversible by heat treatment to dissolve precipitates, followed by rapid cooling.\nThe de-embrittling heat treatment temperature is typically 1100oF (593oC) or higher and may not be\npractical for many equipment items. If the de-embrittled component is exposed to the same service\nconditions it will re-embrittle faster than it did initially.\n4.2.5.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Impact or bend testing of samples removed from service is the most positive indicator of a problem.\nb) Most cases of embrittlement are found in the form of cracking during turnarounds, or during startup or\nshutdown when the material is below about 200oF (93oC) and the effects of embrittlement are most\ndetrimental.\nc) An increase in hardness is another method of evaluating 885oF embrittlement.\n4.2.5.8 Related Mechanisms\nNot applicable.\n4.2.5.9 References\n1. “High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steels,” A Designers Handbook Series, American Iron\nand Steel Institute, Washington, DC, 1979.\n2.

    "text": "4.2.6 Sigma Phase Embrittlement\n4.2.6.1 Description of Damage\nFormation of a metallurgical phase known as sigma phase can result in a loss of fracture toughness in some\nstainless steels as a result of high temperature exposure.\n4.2.6.2 Affected Materials\na) 300 Series SS wrought metals, weld metal, and castings. Cast 300 Series SS including the HK and HP\nalloys are especially susceptible to sigma formation because of their high (10-40%) ferrite content.\nb) The 400 Series SS and other ferritic and martensitic SS with 17% Cr or more are also susceptible (e.g.,\nTypes 430 and 440).\nc) Duplex stainless steels.\n4.2.6.3 Critical Factors\na) Alloy composition, time and temperature are the critical factors.\nb) In susceptible alloys, the primary factor that affects sigma phase formation is the time of exposure at\nelevated temperature.\nc) Sigma phase occurs in ferritic (Fe-Cr), martensitic (Fe-Cr), austenitic (Fe-Cr-Ni) and duplex stainless\nsteels when exposed to temperatures in the range of 1000°F to 1750°F (538 oC to 954oC).\nEmbrittlement can result by holding within or cooling through the transformation range.\nd) Sigma forms most rapidly from the ferrite phase that exists in 300 Series SS and duplex SS weld\ndeposits. It can also form in the 300 Series SS base metal (austenite phase) but usually more slowly.\ne) The 300 Series SS can exhibit about 10% to 15% sigma phase. Cast austenitic stainless steels can\ndevelop considerablly more sigma.\nf) Formation of sigma phase in austenitic stainless steels can also occur in a few hours, as evidenced by\nthe known tendency for sigma to form if an austenitic stainless steel is subjected to a postweld heat\ntreatment at 1275°F (690oC).\ng) The tensile and yield strength of sigmatized stainless steels increases slightly compared with solution\nannealed material. This increase in strength is accompanied by a reduction in ductility (measured by\npercent elongation and reduction in area) and a slight increase in hardness.\nh) Stainless steels with sigma can normally withstand normal operating stresses, but upon cooling to\ntemperatures below about 500oF (260oC) may show a complete lack of fracture toughness as measured\nin a Charpy impact test.\ni) The metallurgical change is actually the precipitation of a hard, brittle intermetallic compound that can\nalso render the material more susceptible to intergranular corrosion. The precipitation rate increases with\nincreasing chromium and molybdenum content.\n4.2.6.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Common examples include stainless steel cyclones, piping ductwork and valves in high temperature\nFCC Regenerator service.\nb) 300 Series SS weld overlays and tube-to-tubesheet attachment welds can be embrittled during PWHT\ntreatment of the underlying CrMo base metal.\nc) Stainless steel heater tubes are susceptible and can be embrittled.\n4.2.6.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Sigma phase embrittlement is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent, and can only be\nconfirmed through metallographic examination and impact testing.\nDecember 2003 API Recommended Practice 571 4-17\nb) Damage due to sigma phase embrittlement appears in the form of cracking, particularly at welds or in\nareas of high restraint.\nc) Tests performed on sigmatized 300 Series SS (304H) samples from FCC regenerator internals have\nshown that even with 10% sigma formation, the Charpy impact toughness was 39 ft-lbs (53 J) at 1200°F\n(649°C).\nd) For the 10% sigmatized specimen, the values ranged from 0% ductility at room temperature to 100% at\n1200°F (649°C). Thus, although the impact toughness is reduced at high temperature, the specimens\nbroke in a 100% ductile fashion, indicating that the wrought material is still suitable at operating\ntemperatures (Table 4-1).\ne) Cast austenitic stainless steels typically have high ferrite/sigma content (up to 40%) and may have very\npoor high temperature ductility.\n4.2.6.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) The best way to prevent sigma phase embrittlement is to use alloys that are resistant to sigma formation\nor to avoid exposing the material to the embrittling range.\nb) The lack of fracture ductility at room temperature indicates that care should be taken to avoid application\nof high stresses to sigmatized materials during shutdown, as a brittle fracture could result.\nc) The 300 Series SS can be de-sigmatized by solution annealing at 1950°F (1066°C) for four hours\nfollowed by a water quench. However, this is not practical for most equipment.\nd) Sigma phase in welds can be minimized by controlling ferrite in the range of 5% to 9% for Type 347 and\nsomewhat less ferrite for Type 304. The weld metal ferrite content should be limited to the stated\nmaximum to minimize sigma formation during service or fabrication, and must meet the stated minimum\nin order to minimize hot short cracking during welding.\ne) For stainless steel weld overlay clad Cr-Mo components, the exposure time to PWHT temperatures\nshould be limited wherever possible.\n4.2.6.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Physical testing of samples removed from service is the most positive indicator of a problem.\nb) Most cases of embrittlement are found in the form of cracking in both wrought and cast (welded) metals\nduring turnarounds, or during startup or shutdown when the material is below about 500oF (260°C) and\nthe effects of embrittlement are most pronounced.\n4.2.6.8 Related Mechanisms\nNot applicable.\n4.2.6.9 References\n1.

    "text": "4.2.7 Brittle Fracture\n4.2.7.1 Description of Damage\nBrittle fracture is the sudden rapid fracture under stress (residual or applied) where the material exhibits little\nor no evidence of ductility or plastic deformation.\n4.2.7.2 Affected Materials\nCarbon steels and low alloy steels are of prime concern, particularly older steels. 400 Series SS are also\nsusceptible.\n4.2.7.3 Critical Factors\na) When the critical combination of three factors is reached, brittle fracture can occur:\ni) The materials’ fracture toughness (resistance to crack like flaws) as measured in a Charpy impact\ntest;\nii) The size, shape and stress concentration effect of a flaw;\niii) The amount of residual and applied stresses on the flaw.\nb) Susceptibility to brittle fracture may be increased by the presence of embrittling phases.\nc) Steel cleanliness and grain size have a significant influence on toughness and resistance to brittle\nfracture.\nd) Thicker material sections also have a lower resistance to brittle fracture due to higher constraint which\nincreases triaxial stresses at the crack tip.\ne) In most cases, brittle fracture occurs only at temperatures below the Charpy impact transition\ntemperature (or ductile-to-brittle transition temperature), the point at which the toughness of the material\ndrops off sharply.\n4.2.7.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Equipment manufactured to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, prior to\nthe December 1987 Addenda, were made with limited restrictions on notch toughness for vessels\noperating at cold temperatures. However, this does not mean that all vessels fabricated prior to this date\nwill be subject to brittle fracture. Many designers specified supplemental impact tests on equipment that\nwas intended to be in cold service.\nb) Equipment made to the same code after this date were subject to the requirements of UCS 66 (impact\nexemption curves).\nc) Most processes run at elevated temperature so the main concern is for brittle fracture during startup,\nshutdown, or hydrotest/tightness testing. Thick wall equipment on any unit should be considered.\nd) Brittle fracture can also occur during an autorefrigeration event in units processing light hydrocarbons\nsuch as methane, ethane/ethylene, propane/propylene, or butane. This includes alkylation units, olefin\nunits and polymer plants (polyethylene and polypropylene). Storage bullets/spheres for light\nhydrocarbons may also be susceptible.\ne) Brittle fracture can occur during ambient temperature hydrotesting due to high stresses and low\ntoughness at the testing temperature.\n4.2.7.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Cracks will typically be straight, non-branching, and largely devoid of any associated plastic deformation\n(no shear lip or localized necking around the crack) (Figure 4-6 to Figure 4-7).\nb) Microscopically, the fracture surface will be composed largely of cleveage, with limited intergranular\ncracking and very little microvoid coalescence.\n4.2.7.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) For new equipment, brittle fracture is best prevented by using materials specifically designed for low\ntemperature operation including upset and autorefrigeration events. Materials with controlled chemical\ncomposition, special heat treatment and impact test verification may be required. Refer to UCS 66 in\nSection VIII of the ASME BPV Code.\nb) Brittle fracture is an “event” driven damage mechanism. For existing materials, where the right\ncombination of stress, material toughness and flaw size govern the probability of the event, an\nengineering study can be performed in accordance with API RP 579, Section 3, Level 1 or 2.\nc) Preventative measures to minimize the potential for brittle fracture in existing equipment are limited to\ncontrolling the operating conditions (pressure, temperature), minimizing pressure at ambient\ntemperatures during startup and shutdown, and periodic inspection at high stress locations.\nd) Some reduction in the likelihood of a brittle fracture may be achieved by:\ni) Performing a post weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the vessel if it was not originally done during\nmanufacturing; or if the vessel has been weld repaired/modified while in service without the\nsubsequent PWHT.\nii) Perform a “warm” pre-stress hydrotest followed by a lower temperature hydrotest to extend the\nMinimum Safe Operating Temperature (MSOT) envelope.\n4.2.7.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Inspection is not normally used to mitigate brittle fracture.\nb) Susceptible vessels should be inspected for pre-existing flaws/defects.\n4.2.7.8 Related Mechanisms\nTemper embrittlement (see 4.2.3), strain age embrittlement (see 4.2.4), 885oF (475oC) embrittlement (see\n4.2.5), titanium hydriding (see 5.1.3.2) and sigma embrittlement (see 4.2.6).\n4.2.7.9 References\n1.

    "text": "4.2.8 Creep and Stress Rupture\n4.2.8.1 Description of Damage\na) At high temperatures, metal components can slowly and continuously deform under load below the yield\nstress. This time dependent deformation of stressed components is known as creep.\nb) Deformation leads to damage that may eventually lead to a rupture.\n4.2.8.2 Affected Materials\nAll metals and alloys.\n4.2.8.3 Critical Factors\na) The rate of creep deformation is a function of the material, load, and temperature. The rate of damage\n(strain rate) is sensitive to both load and temperature. Generally, an increase of about 25°F (12°C) or an\nincrease of 15% on stress can cut the remaining life in half or more, depending on the alloy.\nb) Table 4-2 lists threshold temperatures above which creep damage is a concern. If the metal temperature\nexceeds these values, then creep damage and creep cracking can occur.\nc) The level of creep damage is a function of the material and the coincident temperature/stress level at\nwhich the creep deformation occurs.\nd) The life of metal components becomes nearly infinite at temperatures below the threshold limit (Table 4-\n2) even at the high stresses near a crack tip.\ne) The appearance of creep damage with little or no apparent deformation is often mistakenly referred to as\ncreep embrittlement, but usually indicates that the material has low creep ductility.\nf) Low creep ductility is:\ni) More severe for higher tensile strength materials and welds.\nii) More prevalent at the lower temperatures in the creep range, or low stresses in the upper creep\nrange.\niii) More likely in a coarse-grained material than a fine-grained material.\niv) Not evidenced by a deterioration of ambient temperature properties.\nv) Promoted by certain carbide types in some CrMo steels.\ng) Increased stress due to loss in thickness from corrosion will reduce time to failure.\n4.2.8.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Creep damage is found in high temperature equipment operating above the creep range (Table 4-2).\nHeater tubes in fired heaters are especially susceptible as well as tube supports, hangers and other\nfurnace internals.\nb) Piping and equipment, such as hot-wall catalytic reforming reactors and furnace tubes, hydrogen\nreforming furnace tubes, hot wall FCC reactors, FCC main fractionator and regenerator internals all\noperate in or near the creep range.\nc) Low creep ductility failures have occurred in weld Heat Affected Zones (HAZ) at nozzles and other high\nstress areas on catalytic reformer reactors. Cracking has also been found at long seam welds in some\nhigh temperature piping and in reactors on catalytic reformers.\nd) Welds joining dissimilar materials (ferritic to austenitic welds) may suffer creep related damage at high\ntemperatures due to differential thermal expansion stresses.\n 4.2.8.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) The initial stages of creep damage can only be identified by scanning electron microscope\nmetallography. Creep voids typically show up at the grain boundaries and in later stages form fissures\nand then cracks.\nb) At temperatures well above the threshold limits, noticeable deformation may be observed. For example,\nheater tubes may suffer long term creep damage and exhibit significant bulging before final fracture\noccurs. (Figure 4-9) The amount of deformation is highly dependent on the material, and the combination\nof temperature and stress level (Figure 4-10).\nc) In vessels and piping, creep cracking can occur where high metal temperatures and stress\nconcentrations occur together, such as near major structural discontinuities including pipe tee joints,\nnozzles, or welds at flaws. Creep cracking, once initiated, can progress rapidly.\n4.2.8.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) There is little that inspectors or operators can do to prevent this damage once a susceptible material has\nbeen placed into creep service, other than to minimize the metal temperature, particularly with fired\nheater tubes. Avoiding stress concentrators is important during design and fabrication.\nb) Low creep ductility can be minimized by the careful selection of chemistry for low alloy materials. Higher\npost weld heat treatment temperatures may help minimize creep cracking of materials with low creep\nductility such as 1.25Cr-0.5Mo.\nc) Creep damage is not reversible. Once damage or cracking is detected much of the life of the component\nhas been used up and typically the options are to repair or replace the damaged component. Higher\nPWHT in some cases can produce a more creep ductile material with longer life.\ni) Equipment – Repair of creep damaged catalytic reformer reactor nozzles has been successfully\naccomplished by grinding out the affected area (making sure all the damaged metal is removed),\nre-welding and careful blend grinding to help minimize stress concentration. PWHT temperatures\nmust be carefully selected and may require a higher PWHT than originally specified.\nii) Fired Heater Tubes\n• Alloys with improved creep resistance may be required for longer life.\n• Heaters should be designed and operated to minimize hot spots and localized overheating\n(Figure 4-9).\n• Visual inspection followed by thickness measurements and or strap readings may be required to\nassess remaining life of heater tubes in accordance with API RP 579.\n• Minimizing process side fouling/deposits and fire side deposits/scaling can maximixe tube life.\n4.2.8.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na. Creep damage with the associated microvoid formation, fissuring and dimensional changes is not\neffectively found by any one inspection technique. A combination of techniques (UT, RT, EC,\ndimensional measurements and replication) should be employed. Destructive sampling and\nmetallographic examination are used to confirm damage.\nb. For pressure vessels, inspection should focus on welds of CrMo alloys operating in the creep range.\nThe 1 Cr-0.5Mo and 1.25Cr-0.5Mo materials are particularly prone to low creep ductility. Most\ninspections are performed visually and followed by PT or WFMT on several-year intervals. Angle beam\n(shear wave) UT can also be employed, although the early stages of creep damage are very difficult to\ndetect. Initial fabrication flaws should be mapped and documented for future reference.\nc. Fired heater tubes should be inspected for evidence of overheating, corrosion, and erosion as follows:\ni) Tubes should be VT examined for bulging, blistering, cracking, sagging, and bowing.\nii) Wall thickness measurements of selected heater tubes should be made where wall losses are most\nlikely to occur.\nDecember 2003 API Recommended Practice 571 4-25\niii) Tubes should be examined for evidence of diametric growth (creep) with a strap or go/no go\ngauge, and in limited cases by metallography on in place replicas or tube samples. However,\nmetallography on the OD of a component may not provide a clear indication of subsurface damage.\niv) Retirement criteria based on diametric growth and loss of wall thickness is highly dependent on the\ntube material and the specific operating conditions.\n4.2.8.8 Related Mechanisms\na) Creep damage that occurs as a result of exposure to very high temperatures is described in 4.2.10.\nb) Reheat cracking (see 4.2.19) is a related mechanism found in heavy wall equipment.\n4.2.8.9 References\n1.

    "text": "4.2.9 Thermal Fatigue\n4.2.9.1 Description of Damage\nThermal fatigue is the result of cyclic stresses caused by variations in temperature. Damage is in the form of\ncracking that may occur anywhere in a metallic component where relative movement or differential\nexpansion is constrained, particularly under repeated thermal cycling.\n4.2.9.2 Affected Materials\nAll materials of construction.\n4.2.9.3 Critical Factors\na) Key factors affecting thermal fatigue are the magnitude of the temperature swing and the frequency\n(number of cycles).\nb) Time to failure is a function of the magnitude of the stress and the number of cycles and decreases with\nincreasing stress and increasing cycles.\nc) Startup and shutdown of equipment increase the susceptibility to thermal fatigue. There is no set limit\non temperature swings; however, as a practical rule, cracking may be suspected if the temperature\nswing exceeds about 200°F (93oC).\nd) Damage is also promoted by rapid changes in surface temperature that result in a thermal gradient\nthrough the thickness or along the length of a component. For example: cold water on a hot tube\n(thermal shock); rigid attachments and a smaller temperature differential; inflexibility to accommodate\ndifferential expansion.\ne) Notches (such as the toe of a weld) and sharp corners (such as the intersection of a nozzle with a vessel\nshell) and other stress concentrations may serve as initiation sites.\n4.2.9.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Examples include the mix points of hot and cold streams such as locations where condensate comes in\ncontact with steam systems, such as de-superheating or attemporating equipment (Figure 4-11).\nb) Thermal fatigue cracking has been a major problem in coke drum shells. Thermal fatigue can also occur\non coke drum skirts where stresses are promoted by a variation in temperature between the drum and\nskirt (Figure 4–12 and Figure 4–13).\nc) In steam generating equipment, the most common locations are at rigid attachments between\nneighboring tubes in the superheater and reheater. Slip spacers designed to accommodate relative\nmovement may become frozen and act as a rigid attachment when plugged with fly ash.\nd) Tubes in the high temperature superheater or reheater that penetrate through the cooler waterwall tubes\nmay crack at the header connection if the tube is not sufficiently flexible. These cracks are most\ncommon at the end where the expansion of the header relative to the waterwall will be greatest.\ne) Steam actuated soot blowers may cause thermal fatigue damage if the first steam exiting the soot blower\nnozzle contains condensate. Rapid cooling of the tube by the liquid water will promote this form of\ndamage. Similarly, water lancing or water cannon use on waterwall tubes may have the same effect.\n4.2.9.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Thermal fatigue cracks usually initiate on the surface of the component. They are generally wide and\noften filled with oxides due to elevated temperature exposure. Cracks may occur as single or multiple\ncracks.\nb) Thermal fatigue cracks propagate transverse to the stress and they are usually dagger-shaped,\ntransgranular, and oxide filled (Figure 4-14). However, cracking may be axial or circumferential, or both,\nat the same location.\nc) In steam generating equipment, cracks usually follow the toe of the fillet weld, as the change in section\nthickness creates a stress raiser (Figure 4-15). Cracks often start at the end of an attachment lug and if\nthere is a bending moment as a result of the constraint, they will develop into circumferential cracks into\nthe tube.\nd) Water in soot blowers may lead to a crazing pattern. The predominant cracks will be circumferential and\nthe minor cracks will be axial.\n4.2.9.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) Thermal fatigue is best prevented through design and operation to minimize thermal stresses and\nthermal cycling. Several methods of prevention apply depending on the application.\ni) Designs that incorporate reduction of stress concentrators, blend grinding of weld profiles, and\nsmooth transitions should be used.\nii) Controlled rates of heating and cooling during startup and shutdown of equipment can lower\nstresses.\niii) Differential thermal expansion between adjoining components of dissimilar materials should be\nconsidered.\nb) Designs should incorporate sufficient flexibility to accommodate differential expansion.\ni) In steam generating equipment, slip spacers should slip and rigid attachments should be avoided.\nii) Drain lines should be provided on soot-blowers to prevent condensate in the first portion of the soot\nblowing cycle.\nc) In some cases, a liner or sleeve may be installed to prevent a colder liquid from contacting the hotter\npressure boundary wall\n4.2.9.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Since cracking is usually surface connected, visual examination, MT and PT are effective methods of\ninspection.\nb) External SWUT inspection can be used for non-intrusive inspection for internal cracking and where\nreinforcing pads prevent nozzle examination.\nc) Heavy wall reactor internal attachment welds can be inspected using specialized ultrasonic techniques.\n4.2.9.8 Related Mechanisms\nCorrosion fatigue (see 4.5.2) and dissimilar metal weld cracking (see 4.2.12).\n4.2.9.9 References\n1. “Steam - Its Generation and Use,” 40th Edition, Babcock & Wilcox, 1992.\n2. “Combustion Fossil Power Systems,” Third Edition, Combustion Engineering, CT, 1981.\n3.

    "text": "4.2.11 Steam Blanketing\n4.2.11.1 Description of Damage\nThe operation of steam generating equipment is a balance between the heat flow from the combustion of the\nfuel and the generation of steam within the waterwall or generating tube. The flow of heat energy through the\nwall of the tube results in the formation of discrete steam bubbles (nucleate boiling) on the ID surface. The\nmoving fluid sweeps the bubbles away. When the heat flow balance is disturbed, individual bubbles join to\nform a steam blanket, a condition known as Departure From Nucleate Boiling (DNB). Once a steam blanket\nforms, tube rupture can occur rapidly, as a result of short term overheating, usually within a few minutes.\n4.2.11.2 Affected Materials\nCarbon steel and low alloy steels.\n4.2.11.3 Critical Factors\na) Heat flux and fluid flow are critical factors.\nb) Flame impingement from misdirected or damaged burners can provide a heat flux greater than the steam\ngenerating tube can accommodate.\nc) On the water side, anything that restricts fluid flow (for example, pinhole leaks lower in the steam circuit\nor dented tubes from slag falls) will reduce fluid flow and can lead to DNB conditions.\nd) Failure occurs as a result of the hoop stress in the tube from the internal steam pressure at the elevated\ntemperature.\n4.2.11.4 Affected Units or Equipment\nAll steam-generating units including fired boilers, waste heat exchangers in sulfur plants, hydrogen reformers\nand FCC units.

Proper burner management\nshould be practiced to minimize flame impingement.\nb) Proper BFW treatment can help prevent some conditions that can lead to restricted fluid flow.\nc) Tubes should be visually inspected for bulging.\n4.2.11.7 Inspection and Monitoring\nBurners should be properly maintained to prevent flame impingement.\n4.2.11.8 Related Mechanisms\na) Steam blanketing can cause caustic corrosion (caustic gouging) as outlined in 4.3.10.\nb) Very similar characteristics are observed in short term overheating (see 4.2.10).\n4.2.11.9 References\n1. “Steam - Its Generation and Use,” 40th Edition, Babcock & Wilcox, 1992.\n2. “Combustion Fossil Power Systems,” Third Edition, Combustion Engineering, CT, 1981.\n3.

    "text": "4.2.12 Dissimilar Metal Weld (DMW) Cracking\n4.2.12.1 Description of Damage\nCracking of dissimilar metal welds occurs in the ferritic (carbon steel or low alloy steel) side of a weld\nbetween an austenitic (300 Series SS) and a ferritic material operating at high temperature.\n4.2.12.2 Affected Materials\nThe most common are ferritic materials such as carbon steel and low alloy steels that are welded to the\naustenitic stainless steels as well as any material combinations that have widely differing thermal expansion\ncoefficients.\n4.2.12.3 Critical Factors\na) Important factors include the type of filler metal used to join the materials, heating and cooling rate, metal\ntemperature, time at temperature, weld geometry and thermal cycling.\nb) Cracking occurs because the coefficients of thermal expansion between ferritic steels and 300 Series SS\ndiffer by 30% or more. At high operating temperatures, the differences in expansion lead to high stress at\nthe heat affected zone on the ferritic side.\nc) As the temperature increases, differential thermal expansion between the metals results in increasing\nstress at the weldment, particularly if a 300 Series SS weld metal is used.\nd) Stresses acting on the weldment are significantly higher when an austenitic stainless steel filler metal is\nused. A nickel base filler metal has a coefficient of thermal expansion that is closer to carbon steel,\nresulting in significantly lower stress at elevated temperatures.\ne) At elevated temperatures, the problem is aggravated by the diffusion of carbon out of the heat affected\nzone of the ferritic material and into the weld metal. The loss of carbon reduces the creep strength of the\nferritic material heat affected zone, thereby increasing the cracking probability (Figure 4-19).\nf) The temperature at which carbon diffusion becomes a concern is above 800°F to 950°F (427oC to\n510°C) for carbon steels and low alloy steels.\ng) Ferritic/austenitic joints can generate significant thermal expansion/thermal fatigue stresses at\ntemperatures greater than 510oF (260oC).\nh) Dissimilar metal welds with a 300 Series SS weld metal on a ferritic steel may also result in a narrow\nregion of high hardness at the toe of the weld, near the fusion line on the ferritic steel side. High\nhardness zones render the material susceptible to various forms of environmental cracking such as\nsulfide stress cracking or hydrogen stress cracking.\ni) Thermal cycling aggravates the problem.\nj) In environments that promote liquid ash corrosion, weld cracking problems may be accelerated by\nstress-assisted corrosion. The ferritic heat affected zone will preferentially corrode due to the large\nthermal strain. The results are long, narrow, oxide wedges that parallel the fusion line of the weld\n(Figure 4-20).\nk) Poor geometry of the weld, excessive undercut, and other stress intensification factors will aggravate\ncrack formation.\n4.2.12.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Dissimilar metal welds are utilized in special applications in refineries and other process plants.\nb) Dissimilar metal welds have been used in piping around FCC reactors and regenerator vessels, in fired\nheater applications where the heater tube material changes from 5Cr or 9Cr to 300 Series SS, and in\ntransitions in hydroprocessing reactor outlet piping from overlaid low alloy CrMo nozzles or piping to solid\n300 Series SS piping.\nc) All superheaters and reheaters that have welds between ferritic materials (1.25Cr-0.5Mo and 2.25Cr-\n1Mo) and the austenitic materials (300 Series SS, 304H, 321H, and 347H).\n4.2.12.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) The cracks form at the toe of the weld in the heat-affected zone of the ferritic material (Figure 4-19,\nFigure 4-21 and Figure 4-22).\nb) Welds joining tubes are the most common problem area, but support lugs or attachments of cast or\nwrought 300 Series SS to 400 Series SS are also affected.\n4.2.12.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) Nickel base filler metals which have a coefficient of thermal expansion closer to carbon steel and low\nalloy steels may dramatically increase the life of the joint, because of the significant reduction in thermal\nstress acting on the steel (ferritic) side of the joint.\nb) If 300 Series SS welding electrodes are used, the dissimilar metal weld should be located in a low\ntemperature region.\nc) In steam generating equipment, the weld at the high temperature end should be made in the penthouse\nor header enclosure, out of the heat transfer zone.\nd) Install a pup piece that has an intermediate thermal expansion coefficient between the two materials to\nbe joined.\n4.2.12.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) In fired heater tubes, the cracks form primarily from the outside so that visual, MT and PT inspection\nmethods can be used.\nb) Environmental cracking will also result in surface breaking cracks initiating on the ID surface exposed to\nthe corrosive environment, which can be detected using UT methods.\n4.2.12.8 Related Mechanisms\nThermal fatigue (see 4.2.9) and corrosion fatigue (see 4.5.2).\n4.2.12.9 References\n1. “Steam - Its Generation and Use,” 40th Edition, Babcock & Wilcox, 1992.\n2. “Combustion Fossil Power Systems,” Third Edition, Combustion Engineering, CT, 1981.\n3.

It is critical to consider the role that corrosion contributes.\nb) Metal loss rates depend on the velocity and concentration of impacting medium (i.e., particles, liquids,\ndroplets, slurries, two-phase flow), the size and hardness of impacting particles, the hardness and\ncorrosion resistance of material subject to erosion, and the angle of impact.\nc) Softer alloys such as copper and aluminum alloys that are easily worn from mechanical damage may be\nsubject to severe metal loss under high velocity conditions.\nd) Increasing hardness of the metal substrate is not always a good indicator of improved resistance to\nerosion, particularly where corrosion plays a significant role.\ne) For each environment-material combination, there is often a threshold velocity above which impacting\nobjects may produce metal loss. Increasing velocities above this threshold result in an increase in metal\nloss rates as shown in Table 4-3. This table illustrates the relative susceptibility of a variety of metals\nand alloys to erosion/corrosion by seawater at different velocities.\nf) The size, shape, density and hardness of the impacting medium affects the metal loss rate.\ng) Increasing the corrosivity of the environment may reduce the stability of protective surface films and\nincrease the susceptibility to metal loss. Metal may be removed from the surface as dissolved ions, or as\nsolid corrosion products which are mechanically swept from the metal surface.\nh) Factors which contribute to an increase in corrosivity of the environment, such as temperature, pH, etc.,\ncan increase susceptibility to metal loss.\n4.2.14.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) All types of equipment exposed to moving fluids and/or catalyst are subject to erosion and erosion-\ncorrosion. This includes piping systems, particularly the bends, elbows, tees and reducers; piping\nsystems downstream of letdown valves and block valves; pumps; blowers; propellers; impellers;\nagitators; agitated vessels; heat exchanger tubing; measuring device orifices; turbine blades; nozzles;\nducts and vapor lines; scrapers; cutters; and wear plates.\nb) Erosion can be caused by gas borne catalyst particles or by particles carried by a liquid such as a slurry.\nIn refineries, this form of damage occurs as a result of catalyst movement in FCC reactor/regenerator\nsystems in catalyst handling equipment (valves, cyclones, piping, reactors) and slurry piping; coke\nhandling equipment in both delayed and fluidized bed cokers (Figure 4-23); and as wear on pumps\n(Figure 4-24 and Figure 4-25), compressors and other rotating equipment.\nc) Hydroprocessing reactor effluent piping may be subject to erosion-corrosion by ammonium bisulfide.\nThe metal loss is dependent on the ammonium bisulfide concentration, velocity and alloy corrosion\nresistance.\nd) Crude and vacuum unit piping and vessels exposed to naphthenic acids in some crude oils may suffer\nsevere erosion-corrosion metal loss depending on the temperature, velocity, sulfur content and TAN\nlevel.\n4.2.14.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Erosion and erosion-corrosion are characterized by a localized loss in thickness in the form of pits,\ngrooves, gullies, waves, rounded holes and valleys. These losses often exhibit a directional pattern.\nb) Failures can occur in a relatively short time.\n4.2.14.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) Improvements in design involve changes in shape, geometry and materials selection. Some examples\nare: increasing the pipe diameter to decrease velocity; streamlining bends to reduce impingement;\nincreasing the wall thickness; and using replaceable impingement baffles.\nb) Improved resistance to erosion is usually achieved through increasing substrate hardness using harder\nalloys, hardfacing or surface-hardening treatments. Erosion resistant refractories in cyclones and slide\nvalves have been very successful.\nc) Erosion-corrosion is best mitigated by using more corrosion-resistant alloys and/or altering the process\nenvironment to reduce corrosivity, for example, deaeration, condensate injection or the addition of\ninhibitors. Resistance is generally not improved through increasing substrate hardness alone.\nd) Heat exchangers utilize impingement plates and occasionally tube ferrules to minimize erosion problems.\ne) Higher molybdenum containing alloys are used for improved resistance to naphthenic acid corrosion.\n4.2.14.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Visual examination of suspected or troublesome areas, as well as UT checks or RT can be used to\ndetect the extent of metal loss.\nb) Specialized corrosion coupons and on-line corrosion monitoring electrical resistance probes have been\nused in some applications.\nc) IR scans are used to detect refractory loss on stream.\n4.2.14.8 Related Mechanisms\nSpecialized terminology has been developed for various forms of erosion and erosion-corrosion in specific\nenvironments and/or services.

Inadequate NPSH can result in cavitation.\nb) Temperatures approaching the boiling point of the liquid are more likely to result in bubble formation than\nlower temperature operation.\nc) The presence of solid or abrasive particles is not required for cavitation damage but will accelerate the\ndamage.\n4.2.15.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Cavitation is most often observed in pump casings, pump impellers (low pressure side) and in piping\ndownstream of orifices or control valves.\nb) Damage can also be found in restricted-flow passages or other areas where turbulent flow is subjected\nto rapid pressure changes within a localized region.

    "text": "4.2.16 Mechanical Fatigue\n4.2.16.1 Description of Damage\na) Fatigue cracking is a mechanical form of degradation that occurs when a component is exposed to\ncyclical stresses for an extended period, often resulting in sudden, unexpected failure.\nb) These stresses can arise from either mechanical loading or thermal cycling and are typically well below\nthe yield strength of the material.\n4.2.16.2 Affected Materials\nAll engineering alloys are subject to fatigue cracking although the stress levels and number of cycles\nnecessary to cause failure vary by material.\n4.2.16.3 Critical Factors\nGeometry, stress level, number of cycles, and material properties (strength, hardness, microstructure) are\nthe predominant factors in determining the fatigue resistance of a component.\na) Design: Fatigue cracks usually initiate on the surface at notches or stress raisers under cyclic loading.\nFor this reason, design of a component is the most important factor in determining a component’s\nresistance to fatigue cracking. Several common surface features can lead to the initiation of fatigue\ncracks as they can act as stress concentrations. Some of these common features are:\ni) Mechanical notches (sharp corners or groves);\nii) Key holes on drive shafts of rotating equipment;\niii) Weld joint, flaws and/or mismatches;\niv) Quench nozzle areas;\nv) Tool markings;\nvi) Grinding marks;\nvii) Lips on drilled holes;\nviii) Thread root notches;\nix) Corrosion.\nb) Metallurgical Issues and Microstructure\ni) For some materials such as titanium, carbon steel and low alloy steel, the number of cycles to\nfatigue fracture decreases with stress amplitude until an endurance limit reached. Below this\nstress endurance limit, fatigue cracking will not occur, regardless of the number of cycles.\nii) For alloys with endurance limits, there is a correlation between Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)\nand the minimum stress amplitude necessary to initiate fatigue cracking. The ratio of endurance\nlimit over UTS is typically between 0.4 and 0.5. Materials like austenitic stainless steels and\naluminum that do not have an endurance limit will have a fatigue limit defined by the number of\ncycles at a given stress amptitude.\niii) Inclusions found in metal can have an accelerating effect on fatigue cracking. This is of importance\nwhen dealing with older, “dirty” steels or weldments, as these often have inclusions and\ndiscontinuities that can degrade fatigue resistance.\niv) Heat treatment can have a significant effect on the toughness and hence fatigue resistance of a\nmetal. In general, finer grained microstructures tend to perform better than coarse grained. Heat\ntreatments such as quenching and tempering, can improve fatigue resistance of carbon and low\nalloy steels.\nc) Carbon Steel and Titanium: These materials exhibit an endurance limit below which fatigue cracking will\nnot occur, regardless of the number of cycles.\nd) 300 Series SS, 400 Series SS, aluminum, and most other non-ferrous alloys:\n4-54 API Recommended Practice 571 December 2003\ni) These alloys have a fatigue characteristic that does not exhibit an endurance limit. This means that\nfatigue fracture can be achieved under cyclical loading eventually, regardless of stress amplitude.\nii) Maximum cyclical stress amplitude is determined by relating the stress necessary to cause fracture\nto the desired number of cycles necessary in a component’s lifetime. This is typically 106 to 107\ncycles.\n4.2.16.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Thermal Cycling\ni) Equipment that cycles daily in operation such as coke drums.\nii) Equipment that may be auxiliary or on continuous standby but sees intermittent service such as\nauxiliary boiler.\niii) Quench nozzle connections that see significant temperature deltas during operations such as water\nwashing systems.\nb) Mechanical Loading\ni) Rotating shafts on centrifugal pumps and compressors that have stress concentrations due to\nchanges in radii and key ways.\nii) Components such as small diameter piping that may see vibration from adjacent equipment and/or\nwind. For small components, resonance can also produce a cyclical load and should be taken into\nconsideration during design and reviewed for potential problems after installation.\niii) High pressure drop control valves or steam reducing stations can cause serious vibration problems\nin connected piping.\n4.2.16.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) The signature mark of a fatigue failure is a “clam shell” type fingerprint that has concentric rings called\n“beach marks” emanating from the crack initiation site (Figure 4-29 and Figure 4-30). This signature\npattern results from the “waves” of crack propagation that occur during every cycle above the threshold\nloading. These concentric cracks continue to propagate until the cross-sectional area is reduced to the\npoint where failure due to overload occurs.\nb) Cracks nucleating from a surface stress concentration or defect will typically result in a single “clam shell”\nfingerprint (Figure 4-31, Figure 4-32 and Figure 4-33.).\nc) Cracks resulting from cyclical overstress of a component without significant stress concentration will\ntypically result in a fatigue failure with multiple points of nucleation and hence multiple “clam shell”\nfingerprints. These multiple nucleation sites are the result of microscopic yielding that occurs when the\ncomponent is momentarily cycled above its yield strength.\n4.2.16.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) The best defense against fatigue cracking is good design that helps minimize stress concentration of\ncomponents that are in cyclic service.\nb) Select a metal with a design fatigue life sufficient for its intended cyclic service.\nc) Allow for a generous radius along edges and corners.\nd) Minimize grinding marks, nicks and gouges on the surface of components.\ne) Insure good fit up and smooth transitions for welds. Minimize weld defects as these can accelerate\nfatigue cracking.\nf) Remove any burrs or lips caused by machining.\ng) Use low stress stamps and marking tools.\n4.2.16.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) NDE techniques such as PT, MT and SWUT can be used to detect fatigue cracks at known areas of\nstress concentration.\nb) VT of small diameter piping to detect oscillation or other cyclical movement that could lead to cracking.\nc) Vibration monitoring of rotating equipment to help detect shafts that may be out of balance.\nd) In high cycle fatigue, crack initiation can be a majority of the fatigue life making detection difficult.\n4.2.16.8 Related Mechanisms\nVibration induced fatigue (see 4.2.17).\n4.2.16.9 References\n1. “Fracture and Fatigue Control in Structures,”J.M.

    "text": "4.2.19 Reheat Cracking\n4.2.19.1 Description of Damage\nCracking of a metal due to stress relaxation during Post Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) or in service at\nelevated temperatures. It is most often observed in heavy wall sections.\n4.2.19.2 Affected Materials\nLow alloy steels as well as 300 Series SS and nickel base alloys such as Alloy 800H.\n4.2.19.3 Critical Factors\nImportant parameters include the type of material (chemical composition, impurity elements), grain size,\nresidual stresses from fabrication (cold working, welding), section thickness (which controls restraint and\nstress state), notches and stress concentrators, weld metal and base metal strength, welding and heat\ntreating conditions.\nFrom the various theories of reheat cracking for both 300 Series SS and low alloy steels, cracking features\nare as follows:\na) Reheat cracking requires the presence of high stresses and is therefore more likely to occur in thicker\nsections and higher strength materials.\nb) Reheat cracking occurs at elevated temperatures when creep ductility is insufficient to accommodate the\nstrains required for the relief of applied or residual stresses.\nc) In many cases, cracks are confined to the heat affected zone, initiate at some type of stress\nconcentration, and may act as an initiation site for fatigue.\nd) Reheat cracking can either occur during PWHT or in service at high temperature. In both cases, cracks\nare intergranular and show little or no evidence of deformation.\ne) Fine intragranular precipitate particles make the grains stronger than the grain boundaries and force the\ncreep deformation to occur at the grain boundaries.\nf) Stress relief and stabilization heat treatment of 300 Series SS for maximizing chloride SCC and PTASCC\nresistance can cause reheat cracking problems, particularly in thicker sections.\n4.2.19.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Reheat cracking is most likely to occur in heavy wall vessels in areas of high restraint including nozzle\nwelds and heavy wall piping.\nb) HSLA steels are very susceptible to reheat cracking.\n4.2.19.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\nReheat cracking is intergranular and can be surface breaking or embedded depending on the state of stress\nand geometry. It is most frequently observed in coarse-grained sections of a weld heat affected zone.\n4.2.19.6 Prevention / Mitigation\na) Joint configurations in heavy wall sections should be designed to minimize restraint during welding and\nPWHT. Adequate preheat must also be applied.\nb) The grain size has an important influence on the high temperature ductility and on the reheat cracking\nsusceptibility. A large grain size results in less ductile heat affected zones, making the material more\nsusceptible to reheat cracking.\nc) Metallurgical notches arising from the welding operation are frequently the cause of heat affected zone\ncracking (at the boundary between the weld and the heat affected zone).\nd) In design and fabrication, it is advisable to avoid sharp changes in cross section, such as short radius\nfillets or undercuts that can give rise to stress concentrations. Long-seam welds are particularly\nsusceptible to mismatch caused by fitup problems.\n4.2.19.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Surface cracks can be detected with UT and MT examination of carbon and low alloy steels\nb) UT and PT examination can be used to detect cracks in 300 Series SS and nickel base alloys.\nc) Embedded cracks can only be found through UT examination.\n4.2.19.8 Related Mechanisms\nReheat cracking has also been referred to in the literature as “stress relief cracking” and “stress relaxation\ncracking”.\n4.2.19.9 References\n1.
