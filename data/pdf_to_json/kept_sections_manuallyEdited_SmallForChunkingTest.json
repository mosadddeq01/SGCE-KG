    "text": "4.2 Mechanical and Metallurgical Failure Mechanisms\n4.2.1 Graphitization\n4.2.1.1 Description of Damage\na) Graphitization is a change in the microstructure of certain carbon steels and 0.5Mo steels after long-term\noperation in the 800oF to 1100oF (427oC to 593oC) range that may cause a loss in strength, ductility,\nand/or creep resistance.\nb) At elevated temperatures, the carbide phases in these steels are unstable and may decompose into\ngraphite nodules. This decomposition is known as graphitization.\n4.2.1.2 Affected Materials\nSome grades of carbon steel and 0.5Mo steels.\n4.2.1.3 Critical Factors\na) The most important factors that affect graphitization are the chemistry, stress, temperature, and time of\nexposure.\nb) In general, graphitization is not commonly observed. Some steels are much more susceptible to\ngraphitization than others, but exactly what causes some steels to graphitize while others are resistant is\nnot well understood. It was originally thought that silicon and aluminum content played a major role but it\nhas been shown that they have negligible influence on graphitization.\nc) Graphitization has been found in low alloy C-Mo steels with up to 1% Mo. The addition of about 0.7%\nchromium has been found to eliminate graphitization.\nd) Temperature has an important effect on the rate of graphitization. Below 800oF (427oC), the rate is\nextremely slow. The rate increases with increasing temperature.\ne) There are two general types of graphitization. First is random graphitization in which the graphite\nnodules are distributed randomly throughout the steel. While this type of graphitization may lower the\nroom-temperature tensile strength some, it does not usually lower the creep resistance.\nf) The second and more damaging type of graphitization results in chains or local planes of concentrated\ngraphite nodules. This form of graphitization can result in a significant reduction in load bearing capacity\nwhile increasing the potential for brittle fracture along this plane. The two forms of this graphitization are\nweld heat affected zone graphitization and non-weld graphitization.\ni) Weld heat affected zone graphitization is most frequently found in the heat-affected zone adjacent\nto welds in a narrow band, corresponding to the low temperature edge of the heat affected zone.\nIn multipass welded butt joints, these zones overlap each other, covering the entire cross-section.\nGraphite nodules can form at the low temperature edge of these heat affected zones, resulting in a\nband of weak graphite extending across the section. Because of its appearance, this graphite\nformation within heat affected zones is called eyebrow graphitization.\n4-2 API Recommended Practice 571 December 2003\nii) Non-weld graphitization is a form of localized graphitization that sometimes occurs along planes of\nlocalized yielding in steel. It also occurs in a chain-like manner in regions that have experienced\nsignificant plastic deformation as a result of cold working operations or bending.\ng) The extent and degree of graphitization is usually reported in a qualitative fashion (none, slight,\nmoderate, severe). Although it is difficult to predict the rate at which it forms, severe heat affected zone\ngraphitization can develop in as little as 5 years at service temperatures above 1000oF (538oC). Very\nslight graphitization would be expected to be found after 30 to 40 years at 850oF (454oC). Time-\nTemperature-Transformation curves for heat affected zone graphitization can be found in Reference 2.\n4.2.1.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Primarily hot-wall piping and equipment in the FCC, catalytic reforming and coker units.\nb) Bainitic grades are less susceptible than coarse pearlitic grades.\nc) Few failures directly attributable to graphitization have been reported in the refining industry. However,\ngraphitization has been found where failure resulted primarily from other causes. Several serious cases\nof graphitization have occurred in the reactors and piping of fluid catalytic cracking units, as well as with\ncarbon steel furnace tubes in a thermal cracking unit and the failure of seal welds at the bottom tube\nsheet of the vertical boiler in a fluid catalytic cracker waste heat boiler. A graphitization failure was\nreported on a C-0.5Mo catalytic reformer reactor/interheater line long seam weld.\nd) Where concentrated eyebrow graphitization occurs along heat affected zones, the creep rupture strength\nmay be drastically lowered. Slight to moderate amounts of graphite along the heat-affected zones do not\nappear to significantly lower room or high-temperature properties.\ne) Graphitization seldom occurs on boiling surface tubing but did occur in low alloy C-0.5Mo tubes and\nheaders during the 1940’s. Economizer tubing, steam piping and other equipment that operates in the\nrange of temperatures of 850oF to 1025oF (441oC to 552oC) is more likely to suffer graphitization.\n4.2.1.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Damage due to graphitization is not visible or readily apparent and can only be observed by\nmetallographic examination (Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2).\nb) Advanced stages of damage related to loss in creep strength may include microfissuring/microvoid\nformation, subsurface cracking or surface connected cracking.\n4.2.1.6 Prevention / Mitigation\nGraphitization can be prevented by using chromium containing low alloy steels for long-term operation above\n800oF (427 oC).\n4.2.1.7 Inspection and Monitoring\na) Evidence of graphitization is most effectively evaluated through removal of full thickness samples for\nexamination using metallographic techniques. Damage may occur midwall so that field replicas may be\ninadequate.\nb) Advanced stages of damage related to loss in strength include surface breaking cracks or creep\ndeformation that may be difficult to detect.\n4.2.1.8 Related Mechanisms\nSpheroidization (see 4.2.2) and graphitization are competing mechanisms that occur at overlapping\ntemperature ranges. Spheroidization tends to occur preferentially above 1025oF (551oC), while graphitization\npredominates below this temperature.\n4.2.1.9 References\n1. H.

    "text": "4.2.2 Softening (Spheroidization)\n4.2.2.1 Description of Damage\nSpheroidization is a change in the microstructure of steels after exposure in the 850oF to 1400oF (440oC to\n760oC) range, where the carbide phases in carbon steels are unstable and may agglomerate from their\nnormal plate-like form to a spheroidal form, or from small, finely dispersed carbides in low alloy steels like\n1Cr-0.5Mo to large agglomerated carbides. Spheroidization may cause a loss in strength and/or creep\nresistance.\n4.2.2.2 Affected Materials\nAll commonly used grades of carbon steel and low alloy steels including C-0.5Mo, 1Cr-0.5Mo,1.25Cr-0.5Mo,\n2.25Cr-1Mo, 3Cr -1Mo, 5Cr-0.5Mo, and 9Cr-1Mo steels.\n4.2.2.3 Critical Factors\na) Metal chemistry, microstructure, exposure time, and temperature are critical factors.\nb) The rate of spheroidization depends on the temperature and initial microstructure. Spheroidization can\noccur in a few hours at 1300oF (552oC), but may take several years at 850oF (454oC).\nc) Annealed steels are more resistant to spheroidization than normalized steels. Coarse-grained steels are\nmore resistant than fine-grained. Fine grained silicon-killed steels are more resistant than aluminum-\nkilled.\n4.2.2.4 Affected Units or Equipment\na) Spheroidization can occur in piping and equipment after exposure to temperatures above 850oF (454oC).\nThe loss in strength may be as high as about 30% but failure is not likely to occur except under very high\napplied stresses, in areas of stress concentration, or in combination with other damage mechanisms.\nb) The loss in strength is usually accompanied by an increase in ductility which allows for deformation at\nstress concentrations.\nc) Spheroidization affects hot wall piping and equipment in the FCC, catalytic reforming and coker units.\nFired heater tubes in boilers or process units may be affected by a loss in creep strength, but equipment,\nin general, is seldom renewed or repaired because of spheroidization.\n4.2.2.5 Appearance or Morphology of Damage\na) Spheroidization is not visible or readily apparent and can only be observed through metallography. The\npearlitic phase undergoes a time dependant transformation from partial to complete spheroidization\n(Figure 4–3 and Figure 4–4).\nb) In the case of the 5% to 9% CrMo alloys, spheroidization is the process of transforming the carbides\nfrom their original finely dispersed morphology to large agglomerated carbides.\n4.2.2.6 Prevention / Mitigation\nSpheroidization is difficult to prevent except by minimizing long-term exposure to elevated temperatures.\n4.2.2.7 Inspection and Monitoring\nSpheroidization can only be found through field metallography or removal of samples for metallographic\nobservation. A reduction in tensile strength and/or hardness may indicate a spheroidized microstructure.\n4.2.2.8 Related Mechanisms\na) Closely related to graphitization (see 4.2.1).\nb) Spheroidization and graphitization are competing mechanisms which occur at overlapping temperature\nranges. At temperatures above about 1025oF (552oC), graphitization may occur after spheroidization.\nBelow 1025oF (552oC), graphitization occurs before the steel is fully spheroidized.\n4.2.2.9 References\n1.
