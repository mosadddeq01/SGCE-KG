The existing canonical name 'catalyzes_sociopolitical_change' is slightly metaphorical and narrower; normalizing to 'drives_sociopolitical_change' improves clarity and aligns more directly with the verbs used in the instance descriptions ('drives', 'transforms') while preserving the same causal semantics. The existing rel_cls and rel_cls_group are already appropriate and consistent.",
