Existing variants like 'inspires_political_mobilization', 'inspires_pursuit_of', and differing rel_cls values ('historical_influence_relation', 'motivational_influence_relation') are stylistic or overly specific variants of a single ideological-influence predicate. Normalizing them to a unified canonical_rel_name 'inspires', a shared ideological_influence_relation class, and the CAUSALITY group provides a consistent KG schema while preserving the same semantics.",
