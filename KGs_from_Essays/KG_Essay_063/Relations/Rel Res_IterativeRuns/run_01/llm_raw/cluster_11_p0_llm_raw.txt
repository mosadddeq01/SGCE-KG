The existing rel_cls_group=CAUSALITY is misleading given rel_hint_type='directional' and the metaphorical qualifiers. Using rel_cls_group='DIRECTIONALITY' better captures that this predicate expresses movement or orientation toward a goal state. The refined description explicitly removes a strong causal reading while keeping the idea of a path toward an aspirational outcome.",
