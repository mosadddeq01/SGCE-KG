      "justification": "All three relations link public protest demonstrations to abstract political or moral ends (challenging injustice, demanding accountability, securing rights and freedoms). They share the same semantics of protest-as-instrument toward a goal, so they should use one normalized predicate and one relation class. The canonical_rel_name is unified to 'aims_to_achieve' (previously split between 'aims_at' and 'aims_to_achieve'), and the class labels 'collective_action_purpose_relation' and 'political_struggle_goal_relation' are consolidated into the more consistent 'collective_action_goal_relation'. The broad group AGENCY already fits all three, as these describe intentional goal-directed collective action.",
