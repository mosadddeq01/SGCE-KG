Normalizing the canonical_rel_name and description to 'circulates_within' aligns semantically equivalent predicates. The broader semantics is communication of narratives within groups; temporality is already captured via qualifiers, so the rel_cls_group should be COMMUNICATION rather than TEMPORALITY. Using the same rel_cls 'narrative_dissemination_relation' groups these dissemination edges consistently.",
