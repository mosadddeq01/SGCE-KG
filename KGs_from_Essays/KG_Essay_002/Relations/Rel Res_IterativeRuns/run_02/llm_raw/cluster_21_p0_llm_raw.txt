The existing canonical_rel_name, rel_cls, and rel_cls_group are consistent and appropriate, but the shared canonical_rel_desc is slightly too narrow (focused mainly on settings and supernatural elements). Updating the description to also cover themes and character types better reflects the semantics of these instances while keeping the same predicate and class.",
