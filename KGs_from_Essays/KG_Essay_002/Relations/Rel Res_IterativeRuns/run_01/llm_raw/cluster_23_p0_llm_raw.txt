      "justification": "All four relations link a text-like, information-bearing subject (essay or news report) to the topic or entity it discusses, so they share the same aboutness predicate. Normalizing them under a single canonical description and the class 'document_topic_relation' improves schema consistency. The broad semantic dimension is aboutness/association between document and topic, so 'ASSOCIATION' is more accurate and uniform than mixing 'ASSOCIATION' and 'INFORMATION'.",
