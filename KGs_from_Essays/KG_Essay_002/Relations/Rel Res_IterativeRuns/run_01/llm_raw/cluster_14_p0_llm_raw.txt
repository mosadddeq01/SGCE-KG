They share the same underlying semantic: cultural diffusion of narrative content over space. Normalizing to a single predicate ('spreads_across') and a unified class ('cultural_diffusion_relation') improves schema consistency; 'reaches_scope' and 'is_spread_across' are minor wording variants of the same concept.",
