Unifying them under a single predicate 'features_narrative_role' and class 'narrative_role_relation' improves consistency between instances that are currently split across 'features_character' and 'features_role' and between rel_cls_group values 'COMPOSITION' and 'STRUCTURE'. Using COMPOSITION for all aligns with the idea that these edges describe the cast composition of the narrative.",
