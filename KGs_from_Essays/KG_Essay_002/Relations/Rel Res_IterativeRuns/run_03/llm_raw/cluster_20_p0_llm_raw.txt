The current rel_cls_group 'AGENCY' is overly generic and does not highlight that this is specifically about communication/meaning effects. Aligning them under 'COMMUNICATION' better captures their semantic role while keeping the existing canonical_rel_name and rel_cls, which are already appropriate.",
