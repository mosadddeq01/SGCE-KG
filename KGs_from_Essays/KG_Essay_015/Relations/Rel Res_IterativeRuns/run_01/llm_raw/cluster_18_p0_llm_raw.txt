The current canonical_rel_name 'includes_concept' assumes the subject is the broader belief system that includes the object concept, which is the inverse of the actual direction here. Changing to 'is_concept_included_in' aligns the predicate direction with the subject–object order while keeping it in the same conceptual component / composition family.",
