      "justification": "All these relations describe funerary or mummification-related practices (rituals, procedures, or materials) being applied to or carried out on a specific target (the deceased individual, their body, or a social group such as elites or non-elites). The previous canonical names (e.g., 'performed_for_beneficiary', 'performed_for', 'performed_on', 'applied_to_body_of') are minor wording variants of the same semantic predicate and should be normalized to a single predicate 'applied_to_target' for schema consistency. Similarly, the differing rel_cls values (ritual_beneficiary_relation, procedure_application_relation, treatment_application_relation, ritual_or_practice_target_relation) all describe the same family of relations where a practice targets an entity, so they should be unified under 'ritual_or_practice_target_relation'. At the broadest level, this is best categorized as an INTERACTION (a practice or material interacting with its target) rather than USAGE or AGENCY, so rel_cls_group is normalized to 'INTERACTION'.",
      "remark": "Normalization consolidates several near-duplicate funerary practice–target predicates into a single, reusable schema element while preserving qualifiers for specific contexts.",
