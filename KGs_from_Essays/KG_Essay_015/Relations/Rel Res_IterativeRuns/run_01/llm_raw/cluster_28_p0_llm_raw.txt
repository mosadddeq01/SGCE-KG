Using a single predicate 'has_purpose' normalizes purpose/functional-role semantics across these instances, and unifying the relation class to 'funerary_purpose_relation' avoids an artificial split between 'funerary_function_relation' and 'funerary_object_purpose_relation' while keeping them in the broad USAGE group.",
