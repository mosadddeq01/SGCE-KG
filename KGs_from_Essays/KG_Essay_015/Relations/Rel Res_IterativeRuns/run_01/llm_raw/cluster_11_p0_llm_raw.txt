      "justification": "The first three relations link cultural phenomena (Ancient Egyptian culture; ancient Egyptian burial practices) to the civilization of Ancient Egypt. The current predicate 'occurs_in_civilization' overemphasizes spatiality and sounds event-like, while these are enduring cultural aspects of a civilization, not transient events. A more accurate and reusable predicate is 'is_cultural_aspect_of', with a relation class that explicitly captures civilization–culture links. The broad semantic group is better modeled as ASSOCIATION (civilization–culture association/part–whole) rather than pure SPATIALITY.",
