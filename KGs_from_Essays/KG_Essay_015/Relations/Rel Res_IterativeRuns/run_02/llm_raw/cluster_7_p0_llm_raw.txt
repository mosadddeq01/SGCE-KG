The canonical name 'occurs_in' is appropriate, but the previous class 'spatial_location_relation' was tuned for physical containment (e.g., objects in tombs). Updating the description and rel_cls to emphasize processes/states occurring in physical, conceptual, or spiritual contexts more accurately captures the semantics while keeping the broad group as SPATIALITY.",
