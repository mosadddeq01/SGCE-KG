They currently mix two close canonical predicates ('used_for' and 'has_purpose') and two similar classes ('funerary_object_function_relation' and 'funerary_purpose_relation'). Normalizing to a single predicate 'has_purpose' and a unified class 'funerary_object_purpose_relation' improves schema consistency while accurately capturing their shared semantics.",
