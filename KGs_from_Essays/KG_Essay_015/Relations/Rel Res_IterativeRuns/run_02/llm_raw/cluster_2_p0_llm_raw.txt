      "justification": "For RelR_a4daf5e76391, the subject is the overall process of mummification and the object is 'internal organs'; the description states that mummification includes the step of removing the internal organs. The current canonical_rel_name 'includes_process_step' would be accurate if the object were the step itself (e.g., 'organ removal'), but here the object is the thing being removed. A more precise predicate is needed to capture that the process includes removal of this component, not that the component is a step. The new canonical_rel_name 'involves_removal_of' and its description align the edge semantics with the instance text while keeping it in the same process_decomposition / COMPOSITION family.",
