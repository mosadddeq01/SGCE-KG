The existing canonical_rel_name, rel_cls, and rel_cls_group are appropriate and consistent, but the canonical_rel_desc is overly narrow and framed as 'especially in a ritual or journey context'. A slightly more general description that still mentions the afterlife journey improves reusability and clarity without changing the underlying predicate semantics.",
