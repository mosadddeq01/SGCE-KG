Using a single canonical predicate 'is_version_of' with a unified description avoids unnecessary duplication between 'is_variant_of' and 'is_version_of' while capturing that variants are simply culturally or temporally specific versions. The relation class and group already correctly reflect narrative versioning under IDENTITY, so only the canonical name/description need alignment.",
