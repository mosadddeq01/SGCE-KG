      "remark": "Object entity 'time' is being used in a metaphorical/aggregate way as a stand-in for long historical duration, rather than a specific time period node. Consider later modeling this as a persistence attribute or linking to explicit time-span entities if the temporal model is refined.",
      "justification": "The current schema fields are coherent, but the object node 'time' is ontologically very broad and somewhat non-standard as a temporal anchor. Flagging this now will help future ontology refinement and potential remodelling into more precise temporal constructs.",
