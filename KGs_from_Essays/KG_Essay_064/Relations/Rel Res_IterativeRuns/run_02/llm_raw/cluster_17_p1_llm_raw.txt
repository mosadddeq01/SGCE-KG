However, the current rel_cls_group=CAUSALITY overemphasizes causal mechanisms, while this relation is about source/provenance and historical grounding rather than cause-effect. Changing rel_cls_group to PROVENANCE better reflects that this is an origin/source relation, consistent with rel_hint_type='source' and the description 'rooted in cultural myths'. The canonical_rel_desc is slightly refined to explicitly de-emphasize causality and emphasize provenance.",
