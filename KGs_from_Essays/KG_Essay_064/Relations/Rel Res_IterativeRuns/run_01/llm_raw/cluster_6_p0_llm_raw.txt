Normalizing the predicate to the singular form 'conveys_moral_lesson' improves consistency and avoids unnecessary plurality variation. The previous rel_cls 'narrative_effect_relation' was vague; 'didactic_function_relation' more precisely captures that this is about the didactic function or effect of the narrative, while retaining the broad rel_cls_group 'EFFECT' to indicate the outcome/impact of the narrative content.",
