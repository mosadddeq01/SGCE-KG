      "justification": "This relation links 'fairytales' to 'storytelling' with the description that fairytales function as a form of storytelling. Ontologically this is better modeled as a form/mode-of (subtype) relation rather than a usage relation: fairytales are a kind of storytelling, not merely a tool used for storytelling. Aligning it with 'is_form_of' makes it consistent with RelR_15d1498558e4 and with a classification/identity schema instead of USAGE.",
