They share identical semantics (collection of tales into a corpus). The canonical_rel_name variants 'collects_story' and 'collected_story' should be normalized to a single predicate 'collects_story'. The broader relation class is best described as a textual collection/editorial relation rather than creative authorship, and both should consistently fall under the AGENCY group since the emphasis is on the act of collecting rather than creating the original work.",
