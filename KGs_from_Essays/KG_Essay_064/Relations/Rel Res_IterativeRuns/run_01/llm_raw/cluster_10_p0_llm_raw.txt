They currently use slightly divergent canonical names ('typically_features', 'features_narrative_element', 'features_motif') and two closely related classes ('narrative_motif_relation', 'narrative_element_relation'). Normalizing to a single predicate 'typically_features' with a unified description and a broader class 'narrative_content_relation' removes unnecessary variation while accurately capturing that these links are about typical narrative content elements under COMPOSITION.",
