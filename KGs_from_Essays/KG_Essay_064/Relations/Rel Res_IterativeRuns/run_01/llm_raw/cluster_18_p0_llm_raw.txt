They share the same direction and semantics, so they should use a single normalized predicate 'originates_from'. The relation class can be unified as 'narrative_origin_relation' since each subject is a story or its origins, and the broad group is better modeled as CAUSALITY (source/origin) rather than SPATIALITY. This also removes unnecessary variation between 'origin_context_relation' and 'cultural_origin_relation' while keeping a clear, reusable schema.",
