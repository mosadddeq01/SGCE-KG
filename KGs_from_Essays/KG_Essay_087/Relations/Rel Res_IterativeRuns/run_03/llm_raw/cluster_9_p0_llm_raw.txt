RelR_3caac9b9749c encodes the same semantic pattern (businesses should take cultural considerations into account) but was modeled with the inverse predicate 'should_be_considered_by'. Normalizing it to 'should_take_into_account' aligns all three instances to a single, subject-as-decision-maker predicate and improves schema consistency.",
