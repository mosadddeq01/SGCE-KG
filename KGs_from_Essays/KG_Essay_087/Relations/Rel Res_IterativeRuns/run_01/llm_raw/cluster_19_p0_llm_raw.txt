They already share the canonical_rel_name 'contributes_to' and rel_cls_group 'CAUSALITY' but have slightly divergent canonical_rel_desc wordings and two different, overly specific rel_cls labels ('brand_element_function_relation' vs 'branding_effect_relation'). Normalizing to a unified canonical_rel_desc and a single, more general class 'branding_impact_relation' improves consistency and reuse in the schema.",
