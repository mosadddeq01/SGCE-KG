This dual semantics (ownership + representation) seems acceptable for now but may warrant future review if more fine-grained predicates (e.g., 'owns_brand' vs. 'is_represented_by_brand') are introduced.",
      "justification": "Schema fields are broadly consistent and usable as-is, but there is a subtle mismatch between pure ownership and representational identity that future ontology refinement might want to separate; adding a remark preserves this nuance without changing the current schema.",
