      "justification": "All three relations link the 'butterfly life cycle' to one of its developmental stages (egg, larval, adult) in a part–whole sense. They share identical predicate semantics (life cycle includes stage), so they should use a single normalized canonical_rel_name. The existing variants ('includes_life_cycle_stage', 'includes_life_stage', 'has_life_cycle_stage') are purely wording differences. This is best modeled as a composition relation (stages as components of the overall process), while temporal ordering is captured via qualifiers, so rel_cls_group should be COMPOSITION rather than TEMPORALITY. A unified rel_cls 'life_cycle_stage_relation' is more consistent than mixing with 'process_stage_relation' for the same pattern.",
      "remark": "Normalized all life-cycle-to-stage edges to a single predicate 'includes_life_cycle_stage' and aligned them under the same relation class and COMPOSITION group for schema consistency.",
