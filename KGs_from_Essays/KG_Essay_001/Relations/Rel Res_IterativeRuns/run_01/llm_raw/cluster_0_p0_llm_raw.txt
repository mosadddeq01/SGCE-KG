      "justification": "All five relations describe traits or behaviors that causally reduce harm from a threat (here, predators). Normalizing the predicate to the more general 'protects_from' avoids redundantly encoding 'predators' in the predicate name while keeping the threat type explicit in the object, improving reusability for other threat entities and maintaining them in the same protective_function_relation class under CAUSALITY.",
      "remark": "Chrysalis-to-caterpillar relation (RelR_12db1e24e59d) is kept as 'protects' because the object is the protected entity itself rather than an external threat, so a slightly different but related predicate is appropriate.",
