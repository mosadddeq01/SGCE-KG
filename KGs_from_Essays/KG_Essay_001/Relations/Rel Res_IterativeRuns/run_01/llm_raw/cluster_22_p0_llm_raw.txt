      "justification": "Both relations connect the same entities (adult butterfly stage → butterfly life cycle) with identical semantics: a stage belonging to a life cycle. To ensure schema consistency, they should share a unified canonical predicate. The more specific and clear predicate is 'is_life_cycle_stage_of'. The existing rel_cls 'life_cycle_stage_relation' is appropriate, but the broad group 'COMPOSITION' for RelR_a737134aa14f is less accurate than 'TEMPORALITY', since stages of a life cycle primarily describe temporal phases rather than part-whole composition. Therefore both are normalized to the same canonical_rel_name and rel_cls_group = 'TEMPORALITY'.",
