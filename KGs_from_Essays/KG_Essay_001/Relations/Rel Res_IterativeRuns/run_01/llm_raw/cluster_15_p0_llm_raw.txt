      "justification": "Both relations describe the same reproductive behavior: female butterflies depositing eggs on host plants, which function as oviposition sites. To normalize the schema, they should share a single canonical predicate. 'lays_eggs_on' is a precise, action-focused predicate that directly encodes the egg-deposition event. The broader class 'oviposition_behavior_relation' captures this as a type of reproductive behavior, and the rel_cls_group 'USAGE' reflects that the host plant is being used as an oviposition site rather than representing a purely spatial relation. This also resolves the current inconsistency where one instance is typed as reproductive/usage and the other as spatial.",
