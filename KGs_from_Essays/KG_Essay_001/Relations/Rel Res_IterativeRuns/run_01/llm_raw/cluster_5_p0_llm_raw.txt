      "justification": "All four relations describe where a biological stage or process occurs (in or on leaves, plants, or chrysalis). They currently use two slightly different canonical_rel_name values (occurs_at_location vs occurs_in_location) and two rel_cls values (biological_stage_or_process_location_relation vs spatial_occurrence_relation) for the same spatial-occurrence semantics. Normalizing them to a single canonical_rel_name 'occurs_in_or_on_location' and a unified relation class 'biological_stage_or_process_location_relation' improves schema consistency while keeping rel_cls_group as SPATIALITY.",
