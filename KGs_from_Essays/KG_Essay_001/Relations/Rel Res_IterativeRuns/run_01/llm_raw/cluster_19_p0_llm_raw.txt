      "justification": "The current canonical_rel_name 'is_life_stage_population_of' is overly specific and slightly awkward. The semantics are that 'adult butterflies' are a subset of 'butterflies' defined by life stage. Normalizing to 'is_life_stage_subset_of' keeps the life-stage focus while using a more general, reusable subset-oriented predicate consistent with ontology practice. rel_cls and rel_cls_group remain appropriate as life-stage/temporality relations.",
