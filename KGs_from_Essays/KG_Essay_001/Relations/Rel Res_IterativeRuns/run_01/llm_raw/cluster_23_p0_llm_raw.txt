      "justification": "Both relations describe a process or agent (pollination, butterflies) that supports the reproductive success of plants in a causal but non-deterministic way. The existing canonical_rel_name and description already capture this well, but the rel_cls 'causal_process_relation' is too generic and slightly misleading because one subject is an ecological agent rather than a pure process. Normalizing both instances to a more specific class 'reproductive_support_relation' better reflects that these are causal relations specifically about aiding reproduction, while keeping rel_cls_group as CAUSALITY.",
