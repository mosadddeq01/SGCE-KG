It is semantically the same initiation pattern as RelR_607352c3c8ba (egg-laying initiates the butterfly life cycle). To keep the schema consistent, it should share the same canonical predicate 'initiates', causal relation class, and CAUSALITY group rather than a separate temporality-focused life_cycle_transition_relation.",
