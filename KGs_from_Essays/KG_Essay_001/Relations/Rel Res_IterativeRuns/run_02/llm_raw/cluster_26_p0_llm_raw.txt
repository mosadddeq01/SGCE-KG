Normalizing to a single canonical_rel_name ('is_life_cycle_stage_of') and description improves schema consistency, and using rel_cls_group 'TEMPORALITY' better captures that 'stage' is an ordered temporal phase of the life cycle rather than a generic hierarchy. The last two instances already follow this pattern; the first two are aligned to match.",
