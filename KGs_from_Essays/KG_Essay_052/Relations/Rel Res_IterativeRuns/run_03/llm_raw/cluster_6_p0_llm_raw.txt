The existing canonical names and relation classes diverge only in wording (social_cohesion vs social_connection) while sharing the same underlying predicate semantics. Normalizing them to a single canonical_rel_name and a unified rel_cls avoids trivial variants and better reflects that these edges are about social connection/cohesion between social actors.",
