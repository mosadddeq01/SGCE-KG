Unifying them under a single, consistent canonical_rel_desc improves schema consistency. The outlier rel_cls 'social_impact_relation' for RelR_6254cbcb7ce0 is semantically still about value promotion, so it should be aligned to 'social_value_promotion_relation' to avoid unnecessary fragmentation. The existing rel_cls_group 'CAUSALITY' is already appropriate and does not require change.",
