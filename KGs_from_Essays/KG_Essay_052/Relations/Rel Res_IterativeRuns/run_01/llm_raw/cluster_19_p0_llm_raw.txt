This is best modeled as an interaction between event and audience rather than a generic 'AGENCY' pattern. Renaming the class to 'audience_engagement_relation' makes its scope clearer than the broader 'participation_and_engagement_relation', and aligning the group to 'INTERACTION' better reflects the bidirectional engagement semantics.",
