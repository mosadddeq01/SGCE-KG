The current canonical_rel_name 'uses_for' misleadingly suggests the object is the purpose, whereas the actual purposes appear in qualifiers (e.g., challenging stereotypes, promoting gender equality). Renaming the predicate to 'uses' better captures the agent–instrument semantics while keeping it within the instrumental_use_relation class and USAGE group.",
