Normalizing to 'contributes_to' with a general description and class 'functional_contribution_relation' keeps the edge reusable and consistent with KG best practices, while still correctly capturing that birds causally support ecosystem functioning in this instance. The broad causal nature is already correctly reflected by rel_cls_group = 'CAUSALITY'.",
