Some express direct provision (provides_ecosystem_service) while others express indirect enabling/support (supports_ecosystem_services). The current rel_cls 'ecosystem_service_provision_relation' is too narrow for the support/enablement cases. A more general class 'ecosystem_service_relation' can consistently cover both direct provision and indirect support while keeping the rel_cls_group as FUNCTION.",
