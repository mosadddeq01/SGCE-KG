      "justification": "All five relations describe the same directional semantics: an organism or biological component functionally and causally contributing to an ecological process, outcome, or monitoring activity. The second relation was labeled with a different rel_cls ('biological_process_causal_relation') and a slightly different canonical_rel_desc, but its semantics match the others (bird pollinators contributing to fruit/seed production). For schema consistency, they should share a single canonical_rel_name ('contributes_to'), a unified description, and the same relation class ('functional_contribution_relation') under the broad group 'CAUSALITY'.",
      "remark": "Standardized the relation class and canonical description across all 'contributes_to' instances representing biological/ecological functional contributions.",
