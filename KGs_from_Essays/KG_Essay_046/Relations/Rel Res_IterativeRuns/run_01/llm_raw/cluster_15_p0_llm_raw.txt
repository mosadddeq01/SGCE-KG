Normalizing to a single predicate 'contributes_to_ecosystem_function' with a shared description and class 'ecosystem_function_contribution_relation' ensures consistent schema. The previous variant 'contributes_to_ecosystem_process' and the differing rel_cls_group 'FUNCTIONALITY' on RelR_64bdd9a551dd are semantically equivalent but introduce unnecessary inconsistency; grouping them under CAUSALITY better reflects the contributory (cause–effect) aspect.",
