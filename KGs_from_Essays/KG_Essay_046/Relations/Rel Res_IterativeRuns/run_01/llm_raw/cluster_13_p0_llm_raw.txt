      "justification": "The relation between 'ecosystems' and 'ecosystem functioning' is conceptually the same type of attributive link as the other four relations (stability, condition, health, resilience). Using a special canonical_rel_name ('has_ecosystem_functioning'), a unique rel_cls, and a different rel_cls_group ('PROPERTY') introduces unnecessary heterogeneity. Normalizing this relation to use the same canonical predicate 'has_attribute', the same generic attribute description, the same rel_cls 'state_attribute_relation', and the rel_cls_group 'ATTRIBUTE' aligns all five instances under a single, coherent schema family for ecosystem attributes or states.",
      "remark": "Ecosystem functioning is treated here as an attribute/state-like characteristic of ecosystems for schema consistency with other ecosystem condition attributes.",
