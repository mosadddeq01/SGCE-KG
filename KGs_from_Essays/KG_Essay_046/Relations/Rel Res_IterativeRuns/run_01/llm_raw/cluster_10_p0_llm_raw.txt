      "justification": "For RelR_343e3478734c, the object is 'ecological roles of birds', i.e., the roles themselves, not the ecosystem context. The current canonical_rel_name 'has_ecological_role_in' (with description tying to ecosystem context) fits RelR_b09ef40c9e0f where the object is an ecosystem, but is semantically incorrect for a subject–role relation. Splitting into 'has_ecological_role' for organism→role and keeping 'has_ecological_role_in' for organism→ecosystem yields a cleaner, more precise schema while retaining the same relation class and group.",
      "remark": "Normalized this relation to express a link from birds to their ecological roles, distinct from bird-to-ecosystem context relations.",
