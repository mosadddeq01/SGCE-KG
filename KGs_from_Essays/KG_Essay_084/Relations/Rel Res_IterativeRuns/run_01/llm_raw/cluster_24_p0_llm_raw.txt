      "remark": "The predicate 'takes_place_in' is applied here between an agent ('expert witnesses') and a location ('court'), implicitly referring to the event of their testimony occurring in court. In a more granular schema, this could be modeled via an intermediate testimony event node (e.g., 'expert testimony') that 'takes_place_in' the court and is 'given_by' the expert witnesses.",
      "justification": "The current schema is consistent enough to keep, but this instance slightly stretches the event-oriented predicate to cover an agent–location link. Flagging this helps future ontology refinements consider introducing an explicit testimony event pattern without changing the present edge semantics.",
