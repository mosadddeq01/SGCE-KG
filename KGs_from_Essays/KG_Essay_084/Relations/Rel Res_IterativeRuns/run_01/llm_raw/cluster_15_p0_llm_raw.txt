Keeping the existing specific class 'evidential_significance_relation' is appropriate, but the broad group 'CAUSALITY' is misleading. Mapping it instead to a broader associative dimension (ASSOCIATION) better reflects that the relation encodes relevance/importance between clue and case rather than a direct cause-effect chain.",
