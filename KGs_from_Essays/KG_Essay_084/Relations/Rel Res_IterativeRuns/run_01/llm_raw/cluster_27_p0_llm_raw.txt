Normalizing them to a single canonical_rel_name ('analyzes'), shared description, and shared rel_cls ('forensic_cognitive_activity_relation') improves schema consistency. The second relation previously used a more generic class ('behavior_action_relation') despite clearly describing an analytical activity similar to the other two.",
