They already share the same canonical predicate name 'performs' but had slightly divergent descriptions and different, overlapping relation classes ('process_agent_relation' vs 'behavior_action_relation'). Normalizing them to a single class 'agent_action_relation' and a unified, general canonical description improves schema consistency while preserving the AGENCY semantics.",
