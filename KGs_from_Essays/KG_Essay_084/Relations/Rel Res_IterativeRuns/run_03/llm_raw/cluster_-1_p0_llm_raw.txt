      "justification": "The current canonical_rel_name 'takes_place_in' is event-centric and ambiguous for a direct edge between an agent (expert witnesses) and a location (court). The instance explicitly describes testimony given by expert witnesses in court; aligning the predicate to 'testifies_in' makes the agent-role and courtroom testimony semantics clear while retaining the spatial/legal context class.",
      "remark": "If the KG later introduces explicit testimony event nodes, this edge could be refactored so that 'expert witnesses' PARTICIPATE_IN a 'testimony' event that TAKES_PLACE_IN the 'court'.",
