They currently use slightly different canonical descriptions and two different rel_cls values ('forensic_cognitive_activity_relation' and 'forensic_investigation_activity_relation'). Normalizing them under a single canonical description and a more precise, shared class 'forensic_analysis_activity_relation' improves schema consistency while keeping the broad group as AGENCY.",
