      "justification": "This relation describes the courtroom context of how evidence is introduced during legal proceedings, conceptually as an event of presenting evidence in court. Three other relations in this chunk already use the canonical predicate 'takes_place_in' with the same courtroom context class and group. Normalizing this instance to the same canonical_rel_name and a slightly generalized description makes the schema consistent for courtroom events while keeping it in the SPATIALITY group.",
      "remark": "Interprets the relation as referring to the event of presenting physical evidence in court (rather than the static object alone), aligning it with other courtroom testimony/presentation events modeled with 'takes_place_in'.",
