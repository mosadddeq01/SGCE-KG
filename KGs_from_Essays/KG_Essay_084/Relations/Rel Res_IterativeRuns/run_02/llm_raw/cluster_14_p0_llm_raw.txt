The current canonical_rel_name values ('requires_competence' vs 'requires_competency') and rel_cls values ('competency_dependency_relation' vs 'professional_competency_requirement_relation') are near-duplicates. Normalizing to a single predicate 'requires_competence' and a unified class 'competency_requirement_relation' improves schema consistency while still fitting the broad REQUIREMENT group for all instances.",
