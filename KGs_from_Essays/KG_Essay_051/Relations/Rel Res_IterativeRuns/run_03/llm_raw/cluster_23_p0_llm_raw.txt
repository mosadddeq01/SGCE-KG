The existing canonical_rel_name, rel_cls, and rel_cls_group are appropriate, but the description is slightly narrow (only process/skill/behavior) and does not explicitly clarify its contributory, non-guaranteed nature, which matches the qualifiers like 'can lead to'. The updated description generalizes 'subject factor' and clarifies the contributory (non-sufficient) causal role.",
