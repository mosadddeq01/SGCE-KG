Using 'is_component_of' and 'COMPOSITION' is misleading, as this is about category membership or exemplification, closer to identity/taxonomic semantics than part-whole structure. Normalizing to 'is_example_of' with a 'category_membership_relation' class and rel_cls_group 'IDENTITY' better captures that these behaviors exemplify the category of romantic body language.",
