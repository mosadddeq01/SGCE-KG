They are conceptually the same family and already share rel_cls_group = CAUSALITY. Normalizing their rel_cls to a single label 'social_outcome_facilitation_relation' removes unnecessary micro-variants such as 'social_outcome_enablement_relation' and 'interpersonal_connection_facilitation_relation' while preserving their causal-facilitative semantics.",
