The existing canonical_rel_name 'categorizes' is vague about direction, whereas 'is_classification_scheme_for' clearly encodes that the subject is the scheme and the object is the conceptual domain being classified. The existing rel_cls and rel_cls_group appropriately capture that this is a hierarchical taxonomy-style relation, so only the predicate label and its description are refined for clarity and directionality.",
