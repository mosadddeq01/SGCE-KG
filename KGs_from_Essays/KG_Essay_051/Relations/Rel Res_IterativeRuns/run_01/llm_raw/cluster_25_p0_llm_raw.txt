However, they currently have slightly different and partly confusing canonical_rel_desc texts (including wording like 'example of' and 'category' that can blur part-of vs instance-of semantics). Unifying them under a single clear description focused on part/aspect/modality of a larger whole improves schema consistency without changing their more specific rel_cls distinctions.",
