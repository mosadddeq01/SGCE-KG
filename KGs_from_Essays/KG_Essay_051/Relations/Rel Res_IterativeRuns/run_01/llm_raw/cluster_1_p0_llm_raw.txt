      "justification": "All relations connect a nonverbal behavior or facial expression (gestures, posture, eye contact, facial expressions) to an inferred internal state (emotions, attitudes such as concern, defensiveness, agreement, etc.). The current split into two canonical_rel_names ('signals_emotional_state' vs. 'indicates_state'), two rel_cls values ('nonverbal_signal_relation' vs. 'nonverbal_indicator_relation'), and two rel_cls_groups ('COMMUNICATION' vs. 'ASSOCIATION') is artificial: semantically they are all nonverbal cues that communicate internal states, regardless of whether the object is strictly emotional or more generally psychological/attitudinal. Unifying them under 'indicates_internal_state', with a single class 'nonverbal_state_cue_relation' and broad group 'COMMUNICATION', yields a cleaner, more reusable predicate and avoids redundant, slightly different labels for the same relation family.",
      "remark": "Harmonized facial-expression and body-language indicator relations into a single predicate and class to reflect that they are all communicative nonverbal cues of internal states.",
