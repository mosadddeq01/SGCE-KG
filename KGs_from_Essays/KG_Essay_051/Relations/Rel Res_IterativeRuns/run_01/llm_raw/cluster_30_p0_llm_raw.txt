They already share the canonical name 'facilitates' but have slightly divergent canonical descriptions and different, overlapping relation classes. Unifying them under a single description and a more general yet specific class 'social_outcome_facilitation_relation' provides a consistent schema while preserving their causal-enablement semantics within the CAUSALITY group.",
