      "justification": "Both relations describe studies that numerically estimate a proportion (fraction or percentage) associated with the object: how much of communication is via body language, and the proportion of communication attributed to body language. The current canonical names ('measures_fraction_of' vs. 'quantifies_contribution_of') are redundant variants of the same measurement predicate. Normalizing them to a single canonical predicate 'estimates_proportion_of' improves schema consistency while preserving their shared semantics as quantitative estimations. The existing rel_cls and rel_cls_group are already appropriate and do not need changes.",
