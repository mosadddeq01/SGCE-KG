They share identical causal semantics: the behavior helps build or strengthen social bonds. Unifying them under a single canonical_rel_name and description improves schema consistency. The class label is normalized to 'social_bonding_effect_relation' to cover both 'rapport' and 'connections' while keeping the broad group as CAUSALITY.",
