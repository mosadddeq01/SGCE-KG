They share the same causal-facilitative semantics, so they should use a unified canonical predicate 'facilitates' with a general facilitation-oriented description. The relation class is normalized to 'interpersonal_connection_facilitation_relation' for all, since each instance concerns facilitation of interpersonal connection/rapport specifically rather than generic social effects. The broad group remains CAUSALITY.",
