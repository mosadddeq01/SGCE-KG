This is better modeled as a broad contextual dimension rather than spatial location. The existing rel_cls 'communication_context_relation' is consistent, but the current rel_cls_group 'SPATIALITY' is misleading; updating to 'CONTEXTUALITY' more accurately captures that these edges represent usage/interaction contexts, not physical space.",
