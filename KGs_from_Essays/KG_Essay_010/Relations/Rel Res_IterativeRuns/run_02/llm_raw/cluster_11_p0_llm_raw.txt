      "justification": "This relation instance focuses on the Schwarzschild radius as a defining boundary beyond which escape is impossible, i.e., a physical limit/threshold of the black hole rather than a generic measurement operation. Using rel_cls 'characteristic_boundary_relation' and rel_cls_group 'CONSTRAINT' better captures its role as a boundary/limit, instead of the previous 'measurement_relation' under 'MEASUREMENT'. The canonical name itself is already appropriate and is retained, but its description is refined to emphasize its boundary/limit semantics.",
