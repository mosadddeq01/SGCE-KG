      "justification": "All three relations describe a physical phenomenon (gravitational pull or Hawking radiation) being produced/emitted by a black hole. The existing canonical_rel_name 'originates_from' and rel_cls 'physical_origin_relation' are semantically consistent, but the description only mentioned 'arises from or is generated by' and did not explicitly cover emission. Updating the canonical_rel_desc to include 'emitted' ensures it cleanly applies to the Hawking radiation emission case while remaining correct for gravitational pull coming from a black hole.",
