      "remark": "The current object entity is the event horizon itself, while the description suggests the prevented escape primarily concerns matter and light that have crossed this boundary. This may reflect an upstream modeling choice (using the horizon as a proxy for the region beyond it) rather than the escaping entities themselves.",
      "justification": "Schema fields (canonical_rel_name, rel_cls, rel_cls_group) are consistent with other escape-prevention relations in this cluster, but there is a subtle modeling ambiguity between treating the event horizon as the constrained entity versus the matter/light whose escape is constrained. Flagging this for potential later review without altering the existing schema.",
