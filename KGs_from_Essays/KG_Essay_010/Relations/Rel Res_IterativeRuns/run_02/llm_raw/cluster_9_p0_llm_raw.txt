Normalizing to 'improves_theoretical_description_of' yields a cleaner, reusable predicate focused on the semantic effect (improved theoretical description). The canonical_rel_desc is updated to remove the modal 'could' and to generalize to theoretical description/explanation. The rel_cls is simplified from 'theoretical_explanation_improvement_relation' to 'theoretical_explanation_relation', since the improvement aspect is already captured in the canonical predicate, while keeping rel_cls_group='CAUSALITY' to reflect that the framework is posited as a causal/explanatory improvement over existing theories.",
