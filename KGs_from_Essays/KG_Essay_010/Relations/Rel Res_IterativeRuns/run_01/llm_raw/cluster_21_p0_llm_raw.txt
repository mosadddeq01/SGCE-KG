Normalizing it to 'causes_slower_time_rate_than' keeps the same semantics (a causal effect leading to a slower rate of time in one region compared to another) while providing a more concise, rate-focused predicate consistent with the existing description and qualifiers. The relation class and group are already appropriate and do not need changes.",
