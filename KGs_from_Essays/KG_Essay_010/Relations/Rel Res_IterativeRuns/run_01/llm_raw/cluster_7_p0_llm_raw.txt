The previous canonical name \"advances_knowledge_of\" implies an omitted domain (e.g., knowledge of black holes), which does not match the subject-object pattern here. Renaming to \"expands_knowledge\" and adjusting the description aligns the predicate semantics with the actual edge: the scientists expand the knowledge entity itself.",
