The predicate \"has_research_subject\" captures an aboutness/topic relation between a field and its object of study, rather than an agent performing an action. Therefore, grouping it under a broad ASSOCIATION (aboutness/topic) category is more accurate than AGENCY, which should be reserved for actor-driven activities.",
