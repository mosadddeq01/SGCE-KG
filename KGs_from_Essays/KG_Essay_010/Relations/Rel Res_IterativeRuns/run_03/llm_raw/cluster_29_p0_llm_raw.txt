Although the phenomenon (gravitational time dilation) is causal, the edge itself is about relative rates, aligning better with a COMPARISON group than pure CAUSALITY. The existing rel_cls 'causal_effect_comparison_relation' can remain, but the broader group should emphasize the comparative nature.",
