The intended object concept may be better understood as 'awareness of social injustices' or 'communication about social injustices'; upstream modeling of the object node could be revisited.",
      "justification": "Flags a subtle modeling nuance: the current subject–object pair slightly mismatches the natural language description but does not warrant changing canonical_rel_name, rel_cls, or rel_cls_group. A remark helps future curators reconsider the object entity choice without altering the existing schema fields.",
