While there is a causal mechanism, the primary semantic dimension is representational visibility and voice (who is heard, amplified, or silenced). Using a rel_cls_group of 'REPRESENTATION' better captures this core dimension than the more generic 'CAUSALITY', while the causal nature is already reflected in the canonical descriptions.",
