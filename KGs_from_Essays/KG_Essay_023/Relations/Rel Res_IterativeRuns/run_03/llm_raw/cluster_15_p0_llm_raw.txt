      "remark": "This predicate 'increases_visibility_of' is closely related to the broader 'promotes' predicate used for similar social influence effects in this schema. In a future normalization pass, consider whether to keep this as a distinct, more specific visibility-focused predicate or consolidate it under a single canonical predicate for positive social influence (e.g., 'promotes').",
      "justification": "The current schema is consistent and valid, but this relation sits on the boundary between a specific subtype ('increases_visibility_of') and the more general 'promotes' predicate used elsewhere in the cluster. Flagging it now can help human curators decide later whether more predicate consolidation is desirable for simplicity.",
