They already share the canonical_rel_name 'influences'; however, there are two slightly different canonical_rel_desc variants and two different rel_cls values ('social_media_impact_relation' vs 'influence_relation'). Unifying the description and assigning a single specific class 'social_media_impact_relation' across these instances makes the schema consistent, while keeping rel_cls_group as CAUSALITY unchanged.",
