      "justification": "All relations describe the causal influence of social media on various societal, psychological, and communicative outcomes. Normalizing the predicate to 'has_impact_on' removes the minor variant 'impacts' and yields a consistent causal-impact edge. Similarly, consolidating rel_cls to 'social_media_impact_relation' is appropriate because every instance involves social media as the causal source, whereas the previous split between 'societal_impact_relation' and 'social_media_impact_relation' was arbitrary and redundant.",
