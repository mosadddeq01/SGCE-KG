Normalizing the predicate to a single canonical_rel_name ('enables') reduces trivial variation between 'empowers' and 'enables' while preserving semantics. The previous rel_cls 'voice_representation_relation' is too narrow and object-specific, whereas 'empowerment_enablement_relation' consistently captures the causal empowerment/enablement family for both instances, which both naturally fall under the CAUSALITY group.",
