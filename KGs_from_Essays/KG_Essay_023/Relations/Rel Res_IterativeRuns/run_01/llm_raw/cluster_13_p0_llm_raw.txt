Normalizing rel_cls improves schema consistency. The previous canonical_rel_name 'enables_voice_amplification_of' was slightly awkward and object-order-specific; 'enables_amplification_of_voices' more clearly expresses that social media enables amplification of people's voices without baking in a particular grammatical object form, while still fitting the existing CAUSALITY grouping.",
