They should share a single normalized predicate capturing 'subject is prioritized over object'. The existing rel_cls 'prioritization_relation' is appropriate for this family of preference/priority links. The broad group should be aligned to AGENCY (intentional or systemic prioritization) for both, instead of mixing AGENCY and ASSOCIATION.",
