Using two different canonical predicates ('transforms' vs 'influences') for this symmetric pattern would fragment the schema unnecessarily. 'Influences' matches the broader, reusable description already defined for RelR_ac80d3f0a451 and is appropriate even when the effect is described as fundamental or transformative, so RelR_44a2aebf98c5 should be normalized to this predicate and description for consistency.",
