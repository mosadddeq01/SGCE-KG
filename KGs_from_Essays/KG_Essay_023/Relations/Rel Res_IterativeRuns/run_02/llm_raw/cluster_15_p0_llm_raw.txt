      "justification": "This relation (Twitter enabling advocacy for social or political change) is the same general platform enablement pattern as the other Twitter→X relations in this chunk. Normalizing the canonical_rel_name to 'enables', aligning the description with the existing generic enablement definition, and unifying rel_cls to 'platform_enablement_relation' with rel_cls_group 'CAUSALITY' removes unnecessary predicate and class variants and keeps a consistent schema for platform enablement edges.",
      "remark": "More specific nuances about advocacy and change can remain in the relation description and qualifiers; the predicate-level meaning is generic enablement, shared with the other Twitter enablement relations.",
