The existing canonical_rel_name 'influences' and rel_cls_group 'CAUSALITY' are appropriate, but the canonical_rel_desc and rel_cls are overly domain-specific ('social_media_impact_relation'). Normalizing to a domain-agnostic description and rel_cls 'influence_relation' improves reusability of the predicate family across the KG while preserving the causal semantics.",
