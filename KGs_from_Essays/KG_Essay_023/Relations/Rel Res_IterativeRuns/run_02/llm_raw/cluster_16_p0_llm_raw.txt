Their current rel_cls 'empowerment_enablement_relation' is an unnecessary variant of 'enablement_relation', and their canonical_rel_desc is a slightly different but equivalent wording. Normalizing rel_cls to 'enablement_relation' and canonical_rel_desc to the shared formulation used by the other enablement edges improves schema consistency without changing semantics.",
